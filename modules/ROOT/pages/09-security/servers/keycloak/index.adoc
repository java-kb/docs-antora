Keycloak provides several authentication strategies,
including traditional login forms, social logins via providers like GitHub or Twitter,
and SAML. It also supports two-factor authentication (2FA)

== Installing and running Keycloak

=== Development

==== Using Docker

*run for the first time*

[,console]
----
docker run -d --name Keycloak1 -p 8080:8080 \
        -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
        quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:24.0.5 \
        start-dev --import-realm
----

*import config*

[,console]
----
docker run -d --name Keycloak1 -p 8080:8080 \
        -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin \
        -v ./docker/keycloak/export:/opt/keycloak/data/import \
        quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:24.0.5 \
        start-dev --import-realm
----

*start container*

[,console]
----
docker start Keycloak1
----

==== Kubernetes

==== Using the Keycloak Kubernetes Operator

==== Locally

On Linux or macOS, start Keycloak with the following command:

[,console]
----
export KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin
export KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
cd $KC_HOME
bin/kc.sh start-dev
----

on Windows, execute the following command:

[,console]
----
set KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin
set KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
cd %KC_HOME%
bin\kc.bat start-dev
----

=== Production

=== Clients

* *Valid redirect URIs*: This value is very important in an OpenID Connect authorization
code flow when a client-side application is used. A client-side application is not able to
have any credentials as they would be visible to end users of the application. To prevent
any malicious applications from being able to masquerade as the real application, the
valid redirect URIs instruct Keycloak to only redirect the user to a URL that matches a valid
redirect URI. In this case, since the value is set to http://localhost:8000/, an application
hosted on http://attacker.com would not be able to authenticate.
* *Valid post redirect URIs*: This is the same as the previous value, but for logout requests
rather than login requests, as it is fairly common for an application to have different
redirect URIs for login and logout. Keycloak supports adding a special post redirect URI
with the value +, which results in permitting all valid redirect URIs as post redirect URIs.
* *Web origins*: This option registers the valid web origins of the application for Cross-Or-
igin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests. To obtain tokens from Keycloak, the frontend
application has to send an AJAX request to Keycloak, and browsers do not permit an AJAX
request from one web origin to another, unless CORS is used. Keycloak supports adding
a special web origin with the value +, which results in permitting all valid redirect URIs
as web origins.

== Usage
+
*ID token:*

The ID token is used by the application to establish the identity of the authenticated user.

* *exp*: This is the date and time the token expires in seconds since 01/01/1970 00:00:00 UTC
(often referred to as Unix or Epoch time).
* *iss*: This is the issuer of the token, which you may notice is the URL of the Keycloak realm.
* *sub*: This is the unique identifier of the authenticated user.
* *name*: This is the first name and last name of the authenticated user.
* *preferred_username*: This is the username of the authenticated user. You should avoid this as a key for the user as it may be changed, and may even refer to a different user in the future. Instead, always use the sub field for the user key.

*Access Token*

* *allowed-origins*: This is a list of permitted web origins for the application. The backend
service can use this field when deciding whether web origins should be permitted for
CORS requests.
* *realm_access*: This contains a list of global realm roles. It is the intersection between the
roles granted to the user, and the roles the client has access to.
* *resource_access*: This contains a list of client roles.
* *scope*: Scopes can be used both to decide what fields (or claims) to include in the token
and by backends to decide what APIs the token can access.
== Configuration
=== Managing Realms
In Keycloak, any security aspect of an application or a system is defined in the context
of a realm, a logical domain in which we apply specific security policies. By default,
Keycloak comes preconfigured with a Master realm, but you’ll probably want to create
a dedicated one for each product you build.

open a Terminal window, and enter a bash console inside the Keycloak container:

docker exec -it polar-keycloak bash

navigate to the folder where the Keycloak Admin CLI scripts are located:

cd /opt/keycloak/bin

We’ll need to start an authenticated sessionbefore running any other commands:

 ./kcadm.sh config credentials \
 --server http:/ /localhost:8080 \ 
 --realm master \ 
 --user user \ 
 --password password 

create a new security realm where all the policies associated with Polar Bookshop will be stored: 
 
 ./kcadm.sh create realms -s realm=PolarBookshop -s enabled=true

=== Managing users and roles

To create roles:

 ./kcadm.sh create roles -r PolarBookshop -s name=employee

 ./kcadm.sh create roles -r PolarBookshop -s name=customer

To create users:

 /kcadm.sh create users -r PolarBookshop \
 -s username=isabelle \ 
 -s firstName=Isabelle \
 -s lastName=Dahl \
 -s enabled=true 

 To add user to roles:
 
 ./kcadm.sh add-roles -r PolarBookshop \
 --uusername isabelle \ 
 --rolename employee \
 --rolename customer

To change password:

 ./kcadm.sh set-password -r PolarBookshop \
 --username isabelle --new-password password

=== Managing Clients
To register Edge Service as an OAuth2 Client in the PolarBookshop realm:

 ./kcadm.sh create clients -r PolarBookshop \
        -s clientId=edge-service \ 
        -s enabled=true \ 
        -s publicClient=false \ 
        -s secret=polar-keycloak-secret \ 
        -s 'redirectUris=["http:/ /localhost:9000","http:/ /localhost:9000/login/oauth2/code/*"]'

The valid redirect URLs are the endpoints exposed by the OAuth2 Client application
(Edge Service) where Keycloak will redirect authentication requests. Since Keycloak
can include sensitive information in a redirect request, we want to limit which applica-
tions and endpoints are authorized to receive such information.

== Configuring Access To User Roles In Keycloak
Keycloak comes preconfigured with a roles scope you can use to give an application
access to the user roles contained in a roles claim. However, the default representa-
tion of the roles list is not very convenient to use because it’s defined as a nested
object. 

Once Keycloak is up and running, log in to the administration console, and choose the realm.
Then select Client Scopes from the left menu. On the new page, you’ll
find a list of all the preconfigured scopes in Keycloak, and you have the option to create new ones. In our case, we want to customize the existing roles scope, so click on it to
open its settings.

In the roles scope page, open the Mappers tab. That is where you can define the
set of claims to which the given scope provides access (i.e., mappings). By default, Keycloak already has some mappers defined to map claims to the roles scope. We’re
interested in the realm roles mapper, which maps the user realm roles (including
employee and customer) to a JWT claim. Select that mapper.

The settings page for the realm roles mapper provides a few options for customiza-
tion. We want to change two things:

* The token claim name should be roles instead of realm_access.roles (so we
will remove the nested object).
* The roles claim should be included in both ID Token and Access Token,
