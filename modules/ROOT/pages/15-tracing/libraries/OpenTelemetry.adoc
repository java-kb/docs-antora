= OpenTelemetry
:figures: 15-tracing/libraries

The OpenTelemetry project includes instrumentation that generates traces and spans
for the most common Java libraries, including Spring, Tomcat, Netty, Reactor, JDBC,
Hibernate, and Logback. The OpenTelemetry Java Agent is a JAR artifact provided by
the project that can be attached to any Java application. It injects the necessary byte-
code dynamically to capture traces and spans from all those libraries, and it exports
them in different formats without you having to change your Java source code.

Java agents are often provided to the application at runtime from the outside. For
better dependency management capabilities, in this case, I prefer using Gradle (or
Maven) to include the agent JAR file in the final application artifact.

== intergate with Logging
Besides instrumenting the Java code to capture traces, the OpenTelemetry Java Agent
also integrates with SLF4J (and its implementation). It provides trace and span identi-
fiers as contextual information that can be injected into log messages through the
MDC abstraction provided by SLF4J. That makes it extremely simple to navigate from
log messages to traces and vice versa, achieving better visibility into the application
than querying the telemetry in isolation.

Let’s expand on the default log format used by Spring Boot and add the following
contextual information:
+
* Application name (value from the spring.application.name property we con-
figured for all applications)
* Trace identifier (value from the trace_id field populated by the OpenTeleme-
try agent, when enabled)
* Span identifier (value from the span_id field populated by the OpecnTelemetry
agent, when enabled)

open the application.yml file, and add the three new pieces of information next to the log level (represented by %5p) following the Logback syntax.

logging:
  pattern:
    # Includes application name, trace ID, and span ID next to the log level (%5p)
    level: "%5p [${spring.application.name},%X{trace_id},%X{span_id}]"

== Spring Boot with OpenTelemetry
=== Docker
we’ll enable OpenTelemetry only when running applications in containers and rely on environment variables to configure it.

We need three pieces of configuration to successfully enable tracing:

* Instruct the JVM to load the OpenTelemetry Java agent. We can do that via the
JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS standard environment variable supported by OpenJDK to
provide additional configuration to the JVM.
* Use the application name to tag and categorize traces. We’ll use the OTEL_SERVICE_
NAME environment variable supported by the OpenTelemetry Java agent.
* Define the URL of the distributed tracing backend. In our case, it’s Tempo on port 4317,
and it can be configured via the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT environment variable supported by the OpenTelemetry Java agent. By default, traces are sent
over gRPC.
