== log collectors
We need a log collector to fetch log messages from the standard output of all the run-
ning applications. Using the Grafana stack, youâ€™re free to choose a log collector from
among several options. 
== Logback

Logback is a logging framework for Java that implements SL4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java).
Given that this tool is driven by an external configuration file, you don't need to modify the code in your applications.

In Logback, the piece of logic that writes a log line to the specific destination is called
an appender. This logging library includes some built-in appenders to print messages
to the console (ConsoleAppender) or files (FileAppender and RollingFileAppender).
You didn't need to configure them because Spring Boot includes some default Logback
configuration within its dependencies and also sets up the printed message patterns.

=== Integerate with RabbitMQ

Spring AMQP provides a Logback AMQP logging appender
that does exactly what you need: it takes each log line and produces a message to a given
exchange in RabbitMQ, with a format and some extra options that you can customize.

*Prepare the Logback configuration*

spring Boot allows you to extend the defaults by creating a file named logback-spring.xml in the application resources folder (src/main/resources), which will be picked up
automatically upon application initialization

logback-spring.xml

[,xml]
----
<configuration>

    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/defaults.xml" />
    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/console-appender.xml" />

    <springProperty scope="context" name="rabbitMQHost" source="spring.rabbitmq.host"/>

    <appender name="AMQP"
              class="org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.logback.AmqpAppender">
        <layout>
            <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %logger{36} - %msg</pattern>
        </layout>

        <applicationId>multiplication</applicationId>
        <host>${rabbitMQHost:-localhost}</host>
        <routingKeyPattern>%property{applicationId}.%p</routingKeyPattern>
        <exchangeName>logs.topic</exchangeName>
        <generateId>true</generateId>
        <charset>UTF-8</charset>
        <durable>true</durable>
        <declareExchange>true</declareExchange>
        <deliveryMode>PERSISTENT</deliveryMode>
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE" />
        <appender-ref ref="AMQP" />
    </root>
</configuration>
----

* applicationId: Set it to the application name so you can distinguish
the source when you aggregate logs.
* host: This is the host where RabbitMQ is running. Since it can be
different per environment, you'll connect this value to the
spring.rabbitmq.host Spring property. Spring allows you to do this
via the springProperty tag. You give this Logback property a name,
rabbitMQHost, and you use the ${rabbitMQHost:-localhost} syntax
to either use the property value if it's set or use the default localhost
(defaults are set with the :- separator).
* routingKeyPattern: This is the routing key per message, which you
set to a concatenation of the applicationId and level (notated with
%p) for more flexibility if you want to filter on the consumer side.
* exchangeName: Specify the name of the exchange in RabbitMQ to
publish messages. It'll be a topic exchange by default, so you can call
it logs.topic.
* declareExchange: Set it to true to create the exchange if it's not
there yet.
* durable: Also set this to true so the exchange survives server restarts.
* deliveryMode: Make it PERSISTENT so log messages are stored until
they're consumed by the aggregator.
* generateId: Set it to true so each message will have a unique
identifier.
* charset: It's a good practice to set it to UTF-8 to make sure all parties
use the same encoding.

*Consuming Logs and Printing Them*

*Using Spring boot*

You need a Spring Boot configuration class to declare the exchange, the queue where
you want to consume the messages from, and the binding object to attach the queue
to the topic exchange with a binding key pattern to consume all of them containing the special character (#)

AMQPConfiguration.java

[,java]
----

import org.springframework.amqp.core.*;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AMQPConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public TopicExchange logsExchange() {
        return ExchangeBuilder.topicExchange("logs.topic")
                .durable(true)
                .build();
    }
    @Bean
    public Queue logsQueue() {
        return QueueBuilder.durable("logs.queue").build();
    }
    @Bean
    public Binding logsBinding(final Queue logsQueue,
                               final TopicExchange logsExchange) {
        return BindingBuilder.bind(logsQueue)
                .to(logsExchange).with("#");
    }

}
----

The next step is to create a simple service with the @RabbitListener that maps
the logging level of the received messages, passed as a RabbitMQ message header, to a
logging level in the Logs microservice, using the corresponding log.info(),
log.error(), or log.warn(). Note that you use the @Header annotation here to extract
AMQP headers as method arguments. You also use a logging Marker to add the
application name (appId) to the log line without needing to concatenate it as part of the message

LogsConsumer.java

[,java]
----
import org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.annotation.RabbitListener;
import org.springframework.messaging.handler.annotation.Header;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import org.slf4j.Marker;
import org.slf4j.MarkerFactory;

import lombok.extern.slf4j.Slf4j;
@Slf4j
@Service
public class LogsConsumer {
    @RabbitListener(queues = "logs.queue")
    public void log(final String msg,
                    @Header("level") String level,
                    @Header("amqp_appId") String appId) {
        Marker marker = MarkerFactory.getMarker(appId);
        switch (level) {
            case "INFO" -> log.info(marker, msg);
            case "ERROR" -> log.error(marker, msg);
            case "WARN" -> log.warn(marker, msg);
        }
    }
}
----

Finally, customize the log output produced by this new microservice. Since it'll
aggregate multiple logs from different services, the most relevant property is the
application name. You must override the Spring Boot defaults this time and define a
simple format in a logback-spring.xml file for the CONSOLE appender that outputs the
marker, the level, and the message
logback-spring.xml

[,xml]
----
<configuration>
    <appender name="CONSOLE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <layout class="ch.qos.logback.classic.PatternLayout">
            <Pattern>
                [%-15marker] %highlight(%-5level) %msg%n
            </Pattern>
        </layout>
    </appender>
    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE" />
    </root>
</configuration>
