= Building serverless applications with Spring Cloud Function

Using Spring Cloud Function to implement the business logic as functions, is an excellent choice, since serverless applications are event-driven.

Spring Cloud Function is very flexible. You can integrate it trans-
parently with external messaging systems like RabbitMQ and Kafka, which is ca handy feature for
building serverless applications that are triggered by messages. 

Spring Cloud Function integrates with several communication channels. You can expose functions through exchanges and queues leveraging Spring
Cloud Stream and you can expose them as HTTP endpoints. The framework also supports RSocket, which is a binary reactive protocol, and CloudEvents, a specification
standardizing the format and distribution of events in cloud architectures (https://
cloudevents.io).

Spring Cloud Function lets you expose functions as endpoints triggered by HTTP requests and CloudEvents, which is a specification standardizing the format and distribution of events in cloud architectures.

Spring Cloud Function will automatically expose all the registered functions as HTTP
endpoints when the Spring web dependencies are on the classpath. Each endpoint
uses the same name as the function. In general, suppliers can be invoked through GET
requests and functions and consumers as POST requests.

When only one function is registered as a bean, Spring Cloud Function will automatically
expose it through the root endpoint. In the case of multiple functions, you can choose
the function through the spring.cloud.function.definition configuration property.

For example, we could expose the allQuotes function through the root endpoint.
[source,language,attributes]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: quote-function
  cloud:
    function:
      definition: allQuotes <1>
----

you can leverage the
streaming capabilities of Project Reactor and ask the application to return the response data as they become available. 

http :9102 Accept:text/event-stream --stream

curl -H 'Accept:text/event-stream' localhost:9102

you can build a pipeline by combining functions. When functions are exposed as HTTP endpoints, you can use the comma (,) character to compose functions on the fly. For example, you could combine the genreQuote function with logQuote as follows:

echo 'FANTASY' | http :9102/genreQuote,logQuote

Since logQuote is a consumer, the HTTP response has a 202 status with no body. If
you check the application logs, youâ€™ll see that the random quote by genre has been
printed out instead.

== CloudEvents
CloudEvents can be consumed over HTTP, messaging channels like AMPQ (Rab-
bitMQ), and RSocket. They ensure a standard way of describing events, thus making
them portable across a wide variety of technologies, including applications, messaging
systems, build tools, and platforms.

If your project is already configured to expose functions as HTTP endpoints, you can make it consume CloudEvents without changing any code. Ensure the
application is up and running, and then send an HTTP request with the additional
headers defined by the CloudEvents specification:
