= Hexagonal architecture
:figures: 01-system-design/architecture/hexagonal-architecture

The layered architecture offers developers a simple way to create an application and 
understand the separation of roles or responsibilities. In 2005, Alistar Cockburn23
proposed a new alternative that encapsulates or keeps all external communication with databases or external systems agnostic. To this, he created the concept of input/output 
in the architecture to represent communication with external resources like databases or 
external systems.

Hexagonal architecture, also known as the Ports and Adapters Pattern, is an architectural pattern that aims to create a clear separation between an application’s core logic 
and its interaction with external systems, such as databases, user interfaces, and third-
party services. This separation of concerns helps to achieve a more maintainable, flexi-
ble, and testable application.

The main idea of this type of architecture is to create all the business logic that isolates 
it from the external tools and technologies that are irrelevant to how the application 
works.

This architecture splits the hexagon into two parts. One part is called the “driving 
side,” where the actors start the interaction, such as external systems and web/mobile 
systems. The other part is the “driven side,” where the actors receive a request to obtain 
certain information from a database or other external systems.

hexagonal architecture is an approach to designing software that 
emphasizes the separation of the core business logic from external services. The busi-
ness logic can be thought of as the “brain” of the application. It contains all the import-
ant rules and constructs that the application will need to guarantee the correctness 
of the program. In this analogy, the external services are your “hands” or “eyes;” they 
allow interactions with the outside world (user interfaces, database, etc.).

Hexagonal architecture separates the main program logic from the outside parts like 
buttons, screens, and databases. It makes it easy to change those outside parts without changing the main program. It does this by using ports that define how the outside parts 
can interact with the main program and adapters that make those interactions happen 
in a concrete way.

This approach makes it easier to change and evolve the application over time. If a 
change needs to be made to one of the external systems, the application’s core should 
be unaffected; you only need to update the adapter

== Components
The main components of hexagonal architecture are as follows:

=== Infrastructure 
contains the port and adapters responsible for 
connecting with external systems or databases using different 
protocols. The ports are interfaces agnostic to the technology defining the methods to access the application or other systems. The adapters
are the implementation of the ports related to a specific technology, 
like a query to a database or a REST controller.

=== Use cases 
are the core of the systems because it contains all the logic 
related to various scenarios and how they are related. Depending 
on the author, this component receives other names like application
or domain layer and combines the use cases with the domain 
component.

=== Ports
Interfaces that define the contract between the domain model and the external systems. They represent the input and output boundaries of the application. There are two types of ports: primary and secondary.

– Primary (driven) ports—Define the use cases that the application exposes to 
the external systems. They represent the API that external systems can use to 
interact with the application.
– Secondary (driving) ports—Define the contracts that the application expects 
from external systems, like data repositories or external services.

=== Adapters
The implementations of the ports. Adapters handle communication be-
tween the domain model and the external systems, converting the data and pro-
tocols used by external systems into a format the domain model can understand. 
There are two types of adapters: primary and secondary.
+
– Primary (driven) adapters—Implement the primary ports and are responsible 
for receiving input from external systems and passing it to the domain model. 
– Secondary (driving) adapters—Implement the secondary ports and are respon-
sible for interacting with external systems on behalf of the domain model. 

In hexagonal architecture, the domain model is at the center (the “hexagon”), sur-
rounded by the ports and adapters. The key idea is that any interaction between the 
domain model and external systems must pass through the ports and adapters. This 
architecture allows for easy swapping of external systems, simplified testing by using 
mock implementations of ports, and clear separation of concerns, promoting a more 
maintainable application.

=== The domain model 
Entities are the pure domain of the application, with all the entities 
of value objects used in the application component.

Domain model is the core business logic of the application, including entities, value objects, and domain services. The domain model is isolated from any external 
systems or technologies and should not depend on any implementation-specific 
details like databases or APIs.

The domain model should contain the unvarnished business rules and responsibilities of our application, 
free from the outside world, focusing solely on business logic and workflows. the domain sits at the heart of our application. This is no coincidence, given that it is the heart of the application.

== Driver
A driver is a system external to the 
context boundary of the application that sends requests to the system and, optionally, 
receives responses from the application. A conventional example is a Representational 
State Transfer (commonly referred to as REST) call from a web browser to a REST 
controller. 

== Benefits
This structure has the following benefits.

• You can change or swap adapters without problems.
• The domain and the use cases are pure, so you can understand the 
business logic.
• You can change the implementation of the ports for testing purposes.

== Drawbacks
This type of architecture has the following drawbacks.

• Implementing some frameworks is difficult because you can make 
mistakes with what you consider adapters/ports.
• Introduce indirection to find the implementation of each port.
• No guideline explains all the things about the organization of the 
projects, so anyone can introduce something wrong.
