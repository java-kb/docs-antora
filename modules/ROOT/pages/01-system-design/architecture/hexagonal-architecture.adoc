= Hexagonal architecture
Hexagonal architecture, also known as the Ports and Adapters Pattern, is an architec-
tural pattern that aims to create a clear separation between an application’s core logic 
and its interaction with external systems, such as databases, user interfaces, and third-
party services. This separation of concerns helps to achieve a more maintainable, flexi-
ble, and testable application.

The main components of hexagonal architecture are as follows:

- Domain model—The core business logic of the application, including entities, val-
ue objects, and domain services. The domain model is isolated from any external 
systems or technologies and should not depend on any implementation-specific 
details like databases or APIs.
- Ports—Interfaces that define the contract between the domain model and the ex-
ternal systems. They represent the input and output boundaries of the applica-
tion. There are two types of ports: primary and secondary.

  – Primary (driven) ports—Define the use cases that the application exposes to 
the external systems. They represent the API that external systems can use to 
interact with the application.
    – Secondary (driving) ports—Define the contracts that the application expects 
from external systems, like data repositories or external services.

- Adapters—The implementations of the ports. Adapters handle communication be-
tween the domain model and the external systems, converting the data and pro-
tocols used by external systems into a format the domain model can understand. 
There are two types of adapters: primary and secondary.

    – Primary (driven) adapters—Implement the primary ports and are responsible 
for receiving input from external systems and passing it to the domain model. 
    – Secondary (driving) adapters—Implement the secondary ports and are respon-
sible for interacting with external systems on behalf of the domain model. 

In hexagonal architecture, the domain model is at the center (the “hexagon”), sur-
rounded by the ports and adapters. The key idea is that any interaction between the 
domain model and external systems must pass through the ports and adapters. This 
architecture allows for easy swapping of external systems, simplified testing by using 
mock implementations of ports, and clear separation of concerns, promoting a more 
maintainable application.
