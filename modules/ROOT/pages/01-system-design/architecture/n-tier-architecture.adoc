= N-Tier architecture (layered architecture)
:figures: 01-system-design/architecture

This type of architecture is the simplest because it splits the application into different 
layers like a cake where each layer can only access the elements to the same or the 
inferior level. These types of architecture mutate from architecture with four layers like 
view/presentation, business logic, persistence, and database to others with three or five. 
There is no universal criterion for the correct number of layers. But, if you consider that 
three is a small number of layers, Spring Boot is represented by controllers, services, 
repositories, and the database, which does not appear directly in Spring as layers. 

Benefits

This structure has the following benefits.

• It’s simple to implement and maintain because you only have a 
hierarchy of layers.
• Each layer has only one responsibility and does not know how 
to implement the logic of the other layers, so you can introduce 
modifications in the logic of layers that could not directly 
affect others.
• The structure is more or less the same in all the projects. You 
can change from one project to another and know where to find 
something.

Drawbacks

This type of architecture has the following drawbacks.

• Hiding the use cases, it’s difficult to know where all the classes or 
objects are connected to represent a use case.
• Depending on the size and the number of layers, you can have 
problems with scalability because you can have several classes/
interfaces in the same package or layer.

N-tier architecture, also known as a hierarchical structure with distinct layers, refers to a design
approach for software systems that organizes the application into multiple layers, typically four:
Presentation, Business, Persistence, and Data. This architectural model is commonly employed in
enterprise applications to enhance maintainability by compartmentalizing and promoting modular
development. Each layer has specific responsibilities.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern separates an application into three
interconnected components: Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller
(handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly).

This segmentation facilitates scalability, ease of maintenance, and flexibility in adapting to changing
business requirements.
