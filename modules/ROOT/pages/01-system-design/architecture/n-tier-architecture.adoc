= N-Tier architecture (layered architecture)
:figures: 01-system-design/architecture

With any nontrivial application, it usually makes sense to organize classes by concern. Per-
sistence is one concern; others include presentation, workflow, and business logic. A typ-
ical object-oriented architecture includes layers of code that represent these concerns.

A layered architecture defines interfaces between the code that implements the vari-
ous concerns, allowing changes to be made to the way one concern is implemented
without significant disruption to code in the other layers. Layering determines the
- Layers communicate from top to bottom. A layer is dependent only on the
interface of the layer directly below it.
- Each layer is unaware of any other layers except for the layer just below it and
eventually of the layer above if it receives explicit requests from it.
Different systems group concerns differently, so they define different layers. The typi-
cal, proven, high-level application architecture uses three layers: one each for presen-
tation, business logic, and persistence

This type of architecture is the simplest because it splits the application into different 
layers like a cake where each layer can only access the elements to the same or the 
inferior level. These types of architecture mutate from architecture with four layers like 
view/presentation, business logic, persistence, and database to others with three or five. 
There is no universal criterion for the correct number of layers. But, if you consider that 
three is a small number of layers, Spring Boot is represented by controllers, services, 
repositories, and the database, which does not appear directly in Spring as layers. 

N-tier architecture, also known as a hierarchical structure with distinct layers, refers to a design
approach for software systems that organizes the application into multiple layers, typically four:
Presentation, Business, Persistence, and Data. This architectural model is commonly employed in
enterprise applications to enhance maintainability by compartmentalizing and promoting modular
development. Each layer has specific responsibilities.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern separates an application into three
interconnected components: Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller

The typical, proven, high-level application architecture uses three layers: one each for presentation, business logic, and persistence

- Presentation layer—The user interface logic is topmost. Code responsible for the
presentation and control of page and screen navigation is in the presentation
layer. The user interface code may directly access business entities of the shared
domain model and render them on the screen, along with controls to execute
actions. In some architectures, business entity instances might not be directly
accessible by user interface code, such as when the presentation layer isn’t run-
ning on the same machine as the rest of the system. In such cases, the presenta-
tion layer may require its own special data-transfer model, representing only a
transmittable subset of the domain model. A good example of the presentation
layer is working with a browser to interact with an application.
- Business layer—The business layer is generally responsible for implementing any
business rules or system requirements that are part of the problem domain.
This layer usually includes some kind of controlling component—code that
knows when to invoke which business rule. In some systems, this layer has its
own internal representation of the business domain entities. Alternatively, it
may rely on a domain model implementation that’s shared with the other layers
of the application. A good example of the business layer is the code responsible
for executing the business logic.
- Persistence layer—The persistence layer is a group of classes and components
responsible for storing data to, and retrieving it from, one or more data stores.
This layer needs a model of the business domain entities for which you’d like to
keep a persistent state. The persistence layer is where the bulk of JPA, Hiber-
nate, and Spring Data use takes place.
- Database—The database is usually external. It’s the actual persistent representa-
tion of the system state. If an SQL database is used, the database includes a
schema and possibly stored procedures for the execution of business logic close
to the data. The database is the place where data is persisted for the long term.
- Helper and utility classes—Every application has a set of infrastructural helper or
utility classes that are used in every layer of the application. These may include
general-purpose classes or cross-cutting concern classes (for logging, security,
and caching). These shared infrastructural elements don’t form a layer because
they don’t obey the rules for inter-layer dependency in a layered architecture.

== Benefits
This structure has the following benefits.

• It’s simple to implement and maintain because you only have a 
hierarchy of layers.
• Each layer has only one responsibility and does not know how 
to implement the logic of the other layers, so you can introduce 
modifications in the logic of layers that could not directly 
affect others.
• The structure is more or less the same in all the projects. You 
can change from one project to another and know where to find 
something.

== Drawbacks
This type of architecture has the following drawbacks.

• Hiding the use cases, it’s difficult to know where all the classes or 
objects are connected to represent a use case.
• Depending on the size and the number of layers, you can have 
problems with scalability because you can have several classes/
interfaces in the same package or layer.

(handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly).

This segmentation facilitates scalability, ease of maintenance, and flexibility in adapting to changing
business requirements.
