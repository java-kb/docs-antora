= N-Tier architecture (layered architecture)
:figures: 01-system-design/architecture

N-tier architecture, also known as a hierarchical structure with distinct layers, refers to a design
approach for software systems that organizes the application into multiple layers, typically four:
Presentation, Business, Persistence, and Data. This architectural model is commonly employed in
enterprise applications to enhance maintainability by compartmentalizing and promoting modular
development. Each layer has specific responsibilities.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern separates an application into three
interconnected components: Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller
(handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly).

This segmentation facilitates scalability, ease of maintenance, and flexibility in adapting to changing
business requirements.
