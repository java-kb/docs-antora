== Software architecture styles

Numerous businesses are acquiring computational capabilities from online cloud service platforms
and embracing a primary reliance on the cloud for the development of most applications. This shift
has prompted a transformation in the design of applications.

=== Monolithic architecture

A traditional architecture where the entire application is constructed as a unified and closely
integrated entity.
While it is easy to develop and deploy initially, scaling and maintaining it can pose challenges as the
project expands.

=== N-Tier architecture (layered architecture)

N-tier architecture, also known as a hierarchical structure with distinct layers, refers to a design
approach for software systems that organizes the application into multiple layers, typically four:
Presentation, Business, Persistence, and Data. This architectural model is commonly employed in
enterprise applications to enhance maintainability by compartmentalizing and promoting modular
development. Each layer has specific responsibilities.
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern separates an application into three
interconnected components: Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller
(handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly).
This segmentation facilitates scalability, ease of maintenance, and flexibility in adapting to changing
business requirements.

=== SOA

The service-oriented pattern, also known as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), is an architectural
style that structures a software application as a collection of loosely coupled and independently
deployable services.
Before SOA came into use in the late 1990s, connecting an application to services housed in another
system was a complex process involving point-to-point integration.

=== Microservices architecture

Microservices derive from SOA, but SOA is different from microservices.
This architecture involves fragmenting the application into small, autonomous services that communicate
via APIs. It provides scalability, flexibility, and simplified maintenance, but introduces challenges in
handling distributed systems complexities.

== Cloud-native

the term cloud-native is too ambitious, and sometimes confusing in our
opinion. It's being used to pack a bunch of buzzwords and techniques across multiple
aspects of software development: microservices, event-driven, continuous deployment,
infrastructure-as-code, automation, containers, cloud solutions, and so on.

The problem with cloud-native as a broad-scope classification of applications is that
it can lead people to think they need all the included patterns and methodologies to
achieve the aimed target. Microservices? Sure, it's the new standard. Event-driven? Why
not? Infrastructure as code? Go for it. It looks like only if you can check all the boxes, can
you say you create cloud-native applications. All these patterns and techniques offer
benefits, but do you need all of them for your service or product? Maybe not. You can
build a well-structured monolith, make a container out of it, and deploy it to the cloud
in minutes. On top of that, you can automate all the processes to build the monolith
and take it to production. Is that a cloud-native nonolith? You won't find that definition
anywhere, but that doesn't mean it's not a proper solution for your specific case.
