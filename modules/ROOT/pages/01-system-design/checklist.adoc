**Preventing Conflicts with the Dependencies**

To solve this type of problem or restrict the use of the application to certain versions 
of JDK or Maven, you can use the Enforcer plugin, which has support in Maven or Gradle. The dependencies associated with Spring Boot do not have this problem, but if 
you add other dependencies, the problem could appear, so just in case, add the plugin

==== Rest API
**Documenting the Endpoints**

One of the biggest problems when using another REST API is knowing information 
about the endpoints like the URL, request/response, and HTTP method. There are 
different methods to document all this information. The default standard is OpenAPI Specification. Frameworks like Spring Boot and Quarkus offer libraries to document the endpoints and dynamically generate the documentation

== Logging
**Logging All the Details**
Logging is one of the most relevant features to find and solve problems in pre-productive 
or productive environments because it gives you information that helps you reproduce 
or understand the problem.

How should we version release candidates?:

- semantic versioning (https://semver.org).
- calendar versioning (https://calver.org).
