== Documenting APIs
Documenting APIs is an essential task when you’re following the API-first approach.
In the Spring ecosystem, there are two main options:

* Spring provides a Spring REST Docs project (https://spring.io/projects/spring
-restdocs) that helps you document REST APIs via test-driven development
(TDD), resulting in high-quality and maintainable documentation. The resulting
documentation is aimed at people, relying on formats like Asciidoc or Mark-
down. If you’d like to obtain an OpenAPI representation as well, you can check
the restdocs-api-spec community-driven project to add OpenAPI support to
Spring REST Docs (https://github.com/ePages-de/restdocs-api-spec).
* The springdoc-openapi community-driven project helps automate the gener-
ation of API documentation according to the OpenAPI 3 format (https://
springdoc.org).
