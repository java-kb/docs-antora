= Documentation

some factors to keep in mind when writing docs:
1.Know your audience
Think about who’s going to use your docs. Are they newbies looking for a guide
to get started quickly, or are they tech wizards needing the nitty-gritty details like
API docs and code snippets? Getting a bead on what your readers need is key to
hitting the mark with your content.
2.Keep it simple
Nobody likes to wade through jargon or tech-speak that needs a decoder ring.
Keep your words straightforward and to the point. If your grandparent couldn’t
get it, you’re probably not there yet.
3.Stick to the plan
Keep your docs looking familiar. Use the same style, headings, fonts...you name
it. Consistency is your friend. It’s like having a good rhythm in a song. It just
flows better.
4.Show, don’t just tell
People understand things faster when they see it in action. So, throw in real-life
examples or scenarios. If you’re talking to coders, some code examples are gold.
For others, screenshots or step-by-step walkthroughs can be helpful.
5.A picture is worth a thousand words
Sometimes, text just doesn’t cut it. Use diagrams, screenshots, or even videos to
get your point across, especially when you’re dealing with complex stuff.
6.The why matters as much as the how
Don’t just lay out the steps. Tell your readers why they’re doing what they’re
doing.
