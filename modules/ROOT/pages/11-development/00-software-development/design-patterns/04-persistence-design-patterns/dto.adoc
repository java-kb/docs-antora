= Data Transfer Object (DTO) Design Pattern
:figures: 11-development/00-software-development/design-patterns/04-persistence-design-patterns

The data transfer object (DTO) pattern is used in multiple languages, aggregated, and 
encapsulates data for transfer between the layers of your application or applications. You 
can think of this pattern as a data structure that does not contain any business logic and 
could represent a combination of structures.

This pattern is not something that has appeared recently. Martin Fowler mentioned 
it in 2002 in his book Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. It’s also discussed 
on his webpage.25

This pattern helps to reduce the number of calls to different endpoints or processes 
to obtain all the information necessary to do a certain task, which is expensive in terms 
of time or the size of the information to transfer.

This pattern appears in examples when classes transform the entities used to persist the information into a database and the other application layers.

There are a variety of ways to map objects; some are done manually and imply 
creating a class that receives an object and returns another. Another approach is to use 
libraries like MapStruct, Orika, Dozer, JMapper, and ModelMapper to do most 
of the translation automatically. There are a lot of analyses and benchmarking about 
which library is the best option according to the use of CPU, memory, or complexity to 
implement it.
