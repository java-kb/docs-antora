= Repository Patterns
:figures: 11-development/00-software-development/design-patterns/04-persistence-design-patterns

The repository pattern accesses a database to obtain certain information introducing an 
abstraction for the rest of the layers. The spirit of the repository pattern is to emulate or 
mediate between the domain and data mapping using interfaces to access the domain 
objects.

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that helps manage data by creating a separate place to handle tasks like getting, saving, updating, and deleting data. It connects 
the data source (such as a database or file) to the rest of the application, keeping data access code separate from other code.

== difference between the DAO and repository patterns
The main difference between the DAO and repository patterns is the repositories are 
next to the business logic and try to hide all the logic related to the queries to a database. 
The most common use is to create an interface containing certain methods; frameworks 
like Spring Boot and Quakus transform the methods into specific queries to a database. 
In contraposition, the DAOs implement all the logic using queries to access a database. 

Main Differences Between DAOs and Repositories
|===
|**DAO Pattern** |**Repository Pattern**
|It’s closer to the database because dealing 
queries and tables.
|It’s closer to the business/domain layer because it uses 
abstraction to hide the implementation.
|DAOs could not contain repositories 
because they are in different layers.
|Repositories could contain or implement DAOs.
|It’s an abstraction of the data. |It’s an abstraction of a collection of objects.

== combining DAO and  Repository Patterns
This combination is very infrequently seen because most developers use one or 
another. Spring Data offers a huge set of elements for repositories to solve using only the 
repository interfaces.
