=Specification Pattern
:figures: 11-development/00-software-development/design-patterns/04-persistence-design-patterns

The specification pattern filters or selects a subset of objects based on criteria. For 
example, think that you want to know all the users that have at least two reservations at 
your travel agency, so you create a class that receives each user and checks if that user 
satisfies the conditions or not.

Martin Fowler first discussed the specification pattern a long time ago. Now itâ€™s 
associated directly with the repository pattern, which is in Spring Data to filter the results 
of the table into a database.
