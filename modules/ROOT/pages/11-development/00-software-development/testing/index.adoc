One way of classifying software tests is defined by the Agile Testing Quadrants model originally introduced by Brian Marick, and later described and expanded on by
Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory in their books Agile Testing (Addison-Wesley Professional, 2008), More Agile Testing (Addison-Wesley Professional, 2014), and Agile Testing Condensed (Library and Archives Canada, 2019). Their model was also embraced by Jez Humble and Dave Farley in Continuous Delivery (Addison-Wesley Professional,
2010). The quadrants classify software tests based on whether they are technology or business-facing and whether they support development teams or are used to critique the product.

tests in three out of four quadrants, as shown in figure
