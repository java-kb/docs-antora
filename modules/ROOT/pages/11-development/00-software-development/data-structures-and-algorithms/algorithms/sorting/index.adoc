= Sorting Algorithms
:figures: 11-development/00-software-development/data-structures-and-algorithms/algorithms/sorting

All sorting algorithms accept a list of elements and return them ordered. The main
difference between each algorithm is the manner in which the sorting is done.

== Bubble Sorting

Bubble sorting works by swapping adjacent elements. This pushes the sorted elements toward the end of the list.

== Pseudocode

----
bubbleSort(array)
 n = length(array)
    for (k = 1 until n)
        for (j = 0 until n - 1)
        if(array[j] > array[j + 1])
            swap(array, j, j + 1)
----

Where swap function in switches the values of the two array pointers j and j+1 using a temporary variable.

The algorithm involves three simple
tasks, which involves repeatedly stepping through the list to sort, comparing adjacent
elements, and swapping them around if the first element is bigger than the second.

To guarantee that our list is sorted, we need to do (n - 1) passes on the list, n being the
length of our array. We will show why (n - 1) passes are needed in the next section, but this
is the main reason why bubble sort has a runtime complexity of O(n2), since we're
processing n elements for n - 1 times.

== Improving Bubble Sorting

There are two main techniques we can adopt to improve the performance of bubble sort. It's
important to realize that although both of these strategies improve the overall performance
of bubble sort in the average case; in the worst case, the algorithm still has the same poor
runtime complexity of O(nÂ²).

=== Improvement1

The first small enhancement we can make to the original bubble sort is to make use of the
fact that a sorted "bubble" is building at the end of the list. With every pass we make,
another item is added at the end portion of this bubble. This is the reason why (n - 1) passes
are needed.

We can use this fact so we don't try to sort the elements inside this bubble. We can do this
by slightly modifying our Java code, as shown in Snippet 2.3. In the inner loop, instead of
processing until the end of the list, we can stop just before the sorted bubble, until
numbers.length - i.

[,java]
----
for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < numbers.length - i; j++) {
        if (numbers[j] > numbers[j + 1]) {
            int temp = numbers[j];
            numbers[j] = numbers[j + 1];
            numbers[j + 1] = temp;
        }
    }
}
