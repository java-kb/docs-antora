== Serving Frintend applications
One option is to let Edge Service serve the SPA static resources. Spring Boot applications serving a frontend usually host the source code in src/main/resources. That’s a convenient strategy when using template engines like Thymeleaf, but for SPAs like Angular, I prefer keeping the code in a separate module. SPAs have their own development, build, and release tools, so having a dedicated folder is cleaner and more maintainable. Then you can configure Spring Boot to process the SPA’s static resources
at build time and include them in the final release.

Another option is to have a dedicated service take care of serving the frontend
static resources and packageing the frontend application in an NGINX container.
