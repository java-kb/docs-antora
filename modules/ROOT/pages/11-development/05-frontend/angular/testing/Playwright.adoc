= Playwright

Playwright is a modern, versatile, and powerful browser automation framework created by Microsoft. 
It enables developers to write automated tests, scrape web data, and interact with web applications 
using a single API that works seamlessly across multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and 
Microsoft Edge.

Playwright is a powerful, open source Node.js library for automating and testing web applications 
on various browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It can also automate browser actions 
such as clicks, form fill-ups, and page navigation. Playwright is an intuitive platform supporting 
several programming languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Java. The defining feature 
of parallelism is that you can test for multiple browsers simultaneously without the requirement of 
writing individual tests.

Playwright supports testing across multiple browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. 
This ensures cross-browser compatibility and a consistent user experience.
Playwright is known for its speed and efficiency. Its modern architecture and efficient browser 
automation result in faster test execution compared to other frameworks, reducing the overall time 
spent on testing.
Playwright’s auto-wait API and advanced selector engine significantly improve test stability, reducing 
the likelihood of flaky tests and minimizing the need for manual intervention.
Playwright is built to handle modern web technologies, such as single-page applications (SPAs), 
better than other frameworks. It provides native support for interacting with dynamic content, making 
writing tests for complex applications easier.
Unlike some other frameworks that only support specific browsers, Playwright offers a consistent 
API for testing across multiple browsers, ensuring broader compatibility and a more comprehensive 
testing suite.

Playwright has built-in mocking that allows you to write minified E2E tests at the component level. 
This can be particularly useful for testing complex components without having to interact with the 
entire application.

Playwright supports powerful pseudo-CSS selectors that replace the only use cases for XPath. This 
can make your tests more readable and maintainable.
Playwright is about 30% faster than Selenium running the same tests due to its ability to create test 
contexts in 100 ms.

Playwright requires fewer dependencies and has a more straightforward installation process compared 
to Selenium. This means you can start writing tests more quickly and with less hassle.

== Features of Playwright testing
Let’s look at the key features of Playwright testing:

• Playwright provides consistent and reliable automation across different browsers, ensuring 
your web applications work well on all major platforms.
• Playwright is known for its speed and efficiency, making it a great choice for testing and 
automating web interactions.
• You can run Playwright scripts in headless mode (without a visible browser UI) for faster 
execution, or in headful mode for debugging and interaction.
• Playwright offers support for popular programming languages such as TypeScript, Python, and 
Java. This means you can write automation scripts in the language you’re most comfortable with.
• Playwright uses native browser automation APIs to simulate user interactions accurately, 
resulting in more reliable tests.

You can leverage the full power of browser DevTools with Playwright, making it easier to inspect, 
debug, and diagnose issues in your web applications.
