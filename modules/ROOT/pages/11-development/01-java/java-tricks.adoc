== Basic Elements, Primitive Data Types, and Operators

*_The assignment statement is an expression statement, which means that application
of the binary assignment operator returns the value of the expression on the right-hand side_*

[,java]
----
int j, k;
j = 10; // (1) j gets the value 10, which is returned
k = j; // (2) k gets the value of j, which is 10, and this value is returned

System.out.println(j = 10); // j gets the value 10, which is printed.

k = j = 10; // (k = (j = 10))

Pizza pizzaOne, pizzaTwo;
pizzaOne = pizzaTwo = new Pizza("Supreme"); // Aliases
----

[,java]
----
int[] a = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // An array of int (ยง3.9, p. 119)
int index = 4;
a[index] = index = 2; // (1)
----

The evaluation proceeds as follows:

* a[index] = index = 2; // array index has higher precedence over =
* a[4] = index = 2;
* a[4] = (index = 2); // index gets the value 2. = is right associative.
* a[4] = 2; // The value of a[4] is changed from 50 to 2.

*_Boxing and unboxing in an assignment context:_*

[,java]
----
Boolean boolRef = true; // Boxing.
Byte bRef = 2; // Constant in range: narrowing, then boxing.
// Byte bRef2 = 257; // Constant not in range. Compile-time error!
short s = 10; // Narrowing from int to short.
// Integer iRef1 = s; // short not assignable to Integer.
Integer iRef3 = (int) s; // Explicit widening with cast to int and boxing
boolean bv1 = boolRef; // Unboxing.
byte b1 = bRef; // Unboxing.
int iVal = bRef; // Unboxing and widening.
Integer iRefVal = null; // Always allowed.
// int j = iRefVal; // NullPointerException at runtime.
if (iRef3 != null) iVal = iRef3; // Avoids exception at runtime.
