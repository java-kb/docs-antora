= Java DB JPA

== EJB
Enterprise JavaBeans, or EJB, is a specification for building portable, scalable, and 
reusable business applications without reinventing the way to do certain common things 
like security, access to a database, sending messages across different applications, and 
many more. In the first versions of Java, some of these features existed in other libraries 
or a basic version inside the JDK, so when EJB emerged, unify all these features in the 
same framework.
One of the biggest differences with the previous approach of using JDBC to access 
a database is you need an EJB container that runs inside an application server like 
Glassfish, Wildfly,  and Jetty

== JPA
The Java Persistence API, or JPA, is a specification15 connected directly with the 
persistence into databases. To be more specific, JPA provides a set of interfaces that all 
the providers need to follow to guarantee that there are following the standard so you 
can change the provider without too much effort.

Using JPA, developers can access the information in a database and execute certain 
operations like insert, update, delete and retrieve using a Java class that represents the 
structure of the tables. To do these operations, you need to annotate the classes with 
annotations representing the most common things in a table, such as the table name, 
column size, and the relationship between tables.

JPA offers several ways to do the queries to retrieve the information. One is using 
a SQL statement directly like JDBC with classes to help construct the sentence, and 
another introduces an abstraction so that you donâ€™t need to write the entire sentence 
because the provider of JPA generates the sentence dynamically. 

This specification has many implementations, but the most relevant are Hibernate,16
EclipseLink,17 Apache OpenJPA,18 and Spring Data JPA.19 Each of them implements 
the specification of JPA but differently, prioritizing things like the performance or the 
developer experience.

== Object Mapping
One of the most significant advantages that JPA offers developers is the possibility 
to map a table with a particular class considering all the possible types of columns 
and the relationship between tables. Spring Data extends this approach to all NoSQL 
databases. Each type of database offers its annotations to represent the information to map databases with Java classes.

== Declaring Relationships Among Objects in a Database
JPA and Spring Data support mapping relationships between an object that could 
be stored in another object (table, document, node).
