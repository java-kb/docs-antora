= SSpring Cloud Stream

Spring Cloud Stream, built on top of Spring Cloud Function, provides you with
all the necessary plumbing to integrate your functions with external messaging
systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building scalable, event-driven, and
streaming applications. It’s built on top of Spring Integration, which offers the com-
munication layer with message brokers; Spring Boot, which provides auto-configura-
tion for the middleware integration; and Spring Cloud Function, which produces,
processes, and consumes events. Spring Cloud Stream relies on the native features of
each message broker, but it also provides an abstraction to ensure a seamless experi-
ence independently of the underlying middleware. For example, features like con-
sumer groups and partitions (native in Apache Kafka) are not present in RabbitMQ,
but you can still use them thanks to the framework providing them for you.

The framework supports integrations with RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Kafka Streams,
and Amazon Kinesis. There are also integrations maintained by partners for Google
PubSub, Solace PubSub+, Azure Event Hubs, and Apache RocketMQ.

Spring Cloud Stream is based on a few essential concepts:

-  Destination binder—The component providing the integration with external
messaging systems, like RabbitMQ or Kafka
-  Destination binding—The bridge between the external messaging system entities,
like queues and topics, and the application-provided producers and consumers
-  Message—The data structure used by the application producers and consumers
to communicate with the destination binders, and therefore with the external
messaging systems

All three of these are handled by the framework itself. The core of your application,
the business logic, is not aware of the external messaging system. Destination binders
are responsible for letting the application communicate with the external message
brokers, including any vendor-specific concerns. The bindings are auto-configured by
the framework, but you can still provide your own configuration to adapt them to your needs.

Spring Cloud Function and Spring Boot Starter is already included in Spring Cloud Stream.

Once you implement your functions, you don’t have to make any changes to
your code. You only need to add a dependency on Spring Cloud Stream and
configure it to adapt to your needs.

In Spring Cloud Stream, destination binders provide integration with external
messaging systems.

In Spring Cloud Stream, destination bindings (input and output) bridge the
producers and consumers in your applications with exchanges and queues in a
message broker like RabbitMQ.

Functions and consumers are activated automatically when new messages arrive. Suppliers need to be explicitly activated, such as by explicitly sending a message
to a destination binding.

== Implementing event producers
Suppliers are message sources. They produce messages when an event happens. Unlike functions and consumers, suppliers need to be activated. They act only upon invocation.

Spring Cloud Stream provides a few ways to define suppliers and cover different
scenarios.
== Making messaging resilient to failures
Spring Cloud Stream uses the retry pattern with an exponential backoff strat-
egy by default, relying on the Spring Retry library for imperative consumers and the
retryWhen() Reactor operator for reactive consumers, you can customize it via configuration properties.

Spring Cloud Stream defines several defaults to make the interaction more resil-
ient, including error channels and graceful shutdown. You can configure different
aspects of message processing, including dead-letter queues, acknowledgment flows,
and republishing messages on error.
