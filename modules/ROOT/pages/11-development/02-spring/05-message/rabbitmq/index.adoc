== Using Spring AMQP
Spring AMQP module contains two dependencies:

* spring-rabbit, a set of utils to work with a RabbitMQ broker.
* spring-amqp, which includes all the AMQP abstractions, so that you can make your implementation vendor-independent.

Spring Boot provides a starter for AMQP with extra utilities such as autoconfiguration: spring-boot-starter-amqp. This starter uses both dependencies described earlier, so it implicitly assumes that you'll use a RabbitMQ
broker (since it's the only implementation available).

To use the AMQP and RabbitMQ features in Spring Boot applications.

Spring Cloud Stream will auto-generate and configure the bindings to exchanges and queues in RabbitMQ.

By default, Spring Cloud Stream uses the binding names to generate the names for
exchanges and queues in RabbitMQ, but in a production scenario you’d probably
want to manage them explicitly for several reasons. For example, it’s likely that both exchanges and queues already exist in production. You will also want to control different options for exchanges and queues, like durability or routing algorithms.

to configure input and output bindings. At
startup, Spring Cloud Stream will check if the related exchanges and queues already
exist in RabbitMQ. If they don’t, it will create them according to your configuration.

The output binding (packlabel-out-0) will be mapped to an order-dispatched
exchange in RabbitMQ. The input binding (packlabel-in-0) will be mapped to an
order-accepted exchange and an order-accepted.dispatcher-service queue in
RabbitMQ. If they don’t exist already in RabbitMQ, the binder will create them.

The queue-naming strategy (<destination>.<group>) includes a parameter called con-
sumer group. The idea of consumer groups has been borrowed from Kafka and is very useful. In
a standard pub/sub model, all consumers receive a copy of the messages sent to the
queues they’re subscribed to. That is convenient when different applications need
to process the messages. But in a cloud native context, where multiple instances of
an application are running simultaneously for scaling and resilience, that would be
a problem. If you have numerous Dispatcher Service instances, you don’t want an
order to be dispatched from all of them. That would lead to errors and an inconsistent state.
Consumer groups solve the problem. All consumers in the same group share a sin-
gle subscription. As a consequence, each message arriving at the queue to which
they’re subscribed will be processed by one consumer only. Assume we have two appli-
cations (Dispatcher Service and Mail Service) interested in receiving events about
accepted orders and deployed in a replicated fashion. Using the application name to
configure consumer groups, we can ensure that each event is received and processed
by a single instance of Dispatcher Service and a single instance of Mail Service

Open a browser window and navigate to http:/ /localhost:15672. The credentials
are the same that we defined in Docker Compose (user/password). Then go to the
Exchanges section. Figure 10.12 shows a list of default exchanges provided by
RabbitMQ and the two exchanges generated by our application: order-accepted and
order-dispatched. Spring Cloud Stream maps them to the packlabel-in-0 and
packlabel-out-0 bindings respectively. The exchanges are durable (denoted by the
D icon in the management console), meaning that they will survive a broker restart.

we configured a
packlabel-in-0 binding and a consumer group. That’s the only input channel for
the application, so it should result in a single queue. In the RabbitMQ
management console, you can see a durable order-accepted.dispatcher-service queue in the Queues section.

No queue has been created for the packlabel-out-0 binding because
no consumer subscribed to it.  a queue will be created after configuring a Service to listen to it.
