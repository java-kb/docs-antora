= Spring Security
:figures: 11-development/02-spring/04-security

Spring Security provides its main functionality by relying on filters. Let’s consider a
possible requirement for adding authentication to a Spring Boot application. Users
should be able to authenticate with their username and password through a login
form. When we configure Spring Security to enable such a feature, the framework
adds a filter that intercepts any incoming HTTP request. If the user is already authen-
ticated, it sends the request through to be processed by a given web handler, such as a
@RestController class. If the user is not authenticated, it forwards the user to a login
page and prompts for their username and password.

In imperative Spring applications, a filter is implemented as a Servlet
`Filter` class. In reactive applications, the `WebFilter` class is used.

Most Spring Security features, when enabled, are handled via filters. The framework
establishes a chain of filters that are executed according to a well-defined and sensi-
ble order. For instance, the filter that handles authentication runs before the one
that checks for authorization because we can’t verify a user’s authority before know-
ing who it is.

== Authentication

Spring Security provides several authentication strategies, including HTTP Basic,
login form, SAML, and OpenID Connect. 

With spring boot default configuration, the app has two different authentication
mechanisms in place: HTTP Basic and Form Login, including a username and a password, when you start the application.

HTTP Basic is a way in which a web app authenticates a user by means of a set of credentials (username and password) that the app gets in the header of the HTTP request.

=== Authentication flow in Spring Security

The AuthenticationFilter captures the incoming request and passes the task of authentication to the AuthenticationManager. The AuthenticationManager, in turn, utilizes an authentication provider to carry out the authentication
process. For verifying the username and password, the AuthenticationProvider relies on a UserDetailsService and a PasswordEncoder.

== Customization

Customizer is a contract you implement to define the customization for either Spring Security element you configure: the authentication, the authorization, or particular protection mechanisms such as CSRF or CORS.

Customizer is a functional interface (so we can use lambda expressions to implement it), and the withDefaults() implementation that does nothing:

[,java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Customizer<T> {
 void customize(T t);
 static <T> Customizer<T> withDefaults() {
 return (t) -> {
 };
 }
}
----

A customizer object allows you more flexibility in moving the configuration where needed. Sure, with simple examples, using lambda expressions is comfortable. But in real-world apps, the configurations can grow a lot. In such cases, the ability to move these configurations in separate classes helps you keep the configurations easier to maintain and test.

== Configuring Spring Security
The central place for defining and configuring security policies in Spring Security is a
`SecurityWebFilterChain` bean. That object tells the framework which filters should
be enabled. You can build a `SecurityWebFilterChain` bean through the DSL provided by `ServerHttpSecurity`.

To collect all the configurations related to security, create a SecurityWebFilterChain
bean in a new SecurityConfig class:
[source,java,attributes]
----
@Configuration(proxyBeanMethods = false)
public class SecurityConfig {

	@Bean
	SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
		return http.build();
	}
}
----

The ServerHttpSecurity object, autowired by Spring, provides a convenient DSL for
configuring Spring Security and building a SecurityWebFilterChain bean. 

== HTTP Basic Authentication
== login form Authentication
we can enable login form strategy  via the formLogin() method exposed by the
ServerHttpSecurity object. 

The default configuration (available via the
Spring Security Customizer interface), includes a login page, provided by the
framework out of the box, and an automatic redirect to that page whenever a request
is not authenticated:

[source,java,attributes]
----
@Bean
SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
 return http
 .authorizeExchange(exchange -> exchange.anyExchange().authenticated())
 .formLogin(Customizer.withDefaults()) 
 .build();
}
----
Bydefault, Spring Security defines a user account in memory with the username user
and a password randomly generated and printed out in the application logs. You should
look for a log entry like the following:
[source,console,attributes]
----
Using generated security password: ee60bdf6-fb82-439a-8ed0-8eb9d47bae08
----

== SAML Authentication
== OpenID Connect Authentication

== Logout
In Spring Security, logging out results in all the session data associated with the
user being deleted. When OpenID Connect/OAuth2 is used, the tokens stored by
Spring Security for that user are also deleted. However, the user will still have an active session in identity provider(i.e Keycloak). Just as the authentication process involves both identity provider and your system, completely logging a user out requires propagating the logout request to both components.

== Protecting against Cross-Site Request Forgery
The interaction between the frontend and backend is based on a session cookie. After
the user is successfully authenticated with the OIDC/OAuth2 strategy, Spring will gen-
erate a session identifier to match the authenticated context and send it to the
browser as a cookie. Any subsequent request to the backend will have to contain the
session cookie, from which Spring Security can retrieve the tokens associated with the
specific user and validate the request.

However, session cookies are not enough to validate requests, which are vulnerable
to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. CSRF affects modifying HTTP requests
like POST, PUT, and DELETE. An attacker could induce users to perform requests they
didn’t intend by forging a request meant to cause harm. Forged requests could do
things like transfer money from your bank account or compromise critical data.

Spring Security has built-in protection against such attacks. The protec-
tion is based on a so-called CSRF token generated by the framework that’s provided to
the client at the beginning of the session and required to be sent along with any state-
changing requests.

By default, the generated CSRF token is sent to the browser as an HTTP header. However, Frontend applications like Angular cannot work with that and expect to receive the token
value as a cookie. Spring Security supports this specific requirement, but it’s not
enabled by default.

For imperative applications, You can instruct Spring Security to provide CSRF tokens as cookies through the
csrf() DSL exposed by ServerHttpSecurity and the CookieServerCsrfTokenRepository class.

for reactive applications like Edge Service, you need to take an extra step to ensure the
CsrfToken value is actually provided.  reactive streams need to be subscribed to in order to
activate them. At the moment, CookieServerCsrfTokenRepository doesn’t ensure a
subscription to CsrfToken, so you must explicitly provide a workaround in a Web-
Filter bean. This problem should be solved in future versions of Spring Security (see
issue 5766 on GitHub: https://mng.bz/XW89). For now, update the SecurityConfig
class as follows.

== return an HTTP 401 response when a request is unauthenticated
With a single-page application, things work a bit differently. The Angular applica-
tion is returned by the backend when accessing the root endpoint through a standard
HTTP GET request performed by the browser. After that first step, the SPA interacts
with the backend through AJAX requests. When the SPA sends an unauthenticated
AJAX request to a protected endpoint, you don’t want Spring Security to reply with an
HTTP 302 response redirecting to Keycloak. Instead, you want it to return a response
with an error status like HTTP 401 Unauthorized.

The main reason for not using redirects with SPAs is that you would run into Cross-
Origin Request Sharing (CORS) issues. Consider the scenario where an SPA is served
from https:/ /client.polarbookshop.com and makes HTTP calls through AJAX to a backend at https:/ /server.polarbookshop.com. The communication is blocked because
the two URLs don’t have the same origin (the same protocol, domain, and port).
That’s the standard same-origin policy enforced by all web browsers.

If  Spring Security is configured to reply to an unauthenticated AJAX
call with a redirect to Keycloak (having a different origin). In that case, the request
will be blocked because redirects to different origins are not permitted during
AJAX requests.

When changing the Spring Security configuration to reply with an HTTP 401
response to unauthenticated requests, it’s up to the SPA to handle the error and call
the backend to initiate the authentication flow.  w. Redirects are only a problem during
AJAX requests. The crucial part here is that the call to the backend to start the user
authentication is not an AJAX request sent by Angular. Instead, it’s a standard HTTP
call sent from the browser, like the following:
[source,javascript,attributes]
----
login(): void {
 window.open('/oauth2/authorization/keycloak', '_self');
}
----
 the login call is not an AJAX request sent from the Angular Http-
Client. Instead, it instructs the browser to call the login URL. Spring Security exposes
an /oauth2/authorization/{registrationId} endpoint that you can use to start the
authentication flow based on OAuth2/OIDC.

To make that possible, we need to define a custom AuthenticationEntryPoint to
instruct Spring Security to reply with an HTTP 401 status when an unauthenticated
request is received for a protected resource. The framework already provides an Http-
StatusServerEntryPoint implementation that perfectly suits this scenario, since it
lets you specify which HTTP status to return when a user is required to authenticate.
[source,java,attributes]
----
    @Bean
    SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http,
            ReactiveClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrationRepository) {
        return http
                .authorizeExchange(exchange -> exchange
                        .anyExchange().authenticated())
                 // When an exception is thrown because a user is not authenticated, it replies
                // with an HTTP 401 response.
                .exceptionHandling(exceptionHandling -> exceptionHandling
                        .authenticationEntryPoint(new HttpStatusServerEntryPoint(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED)))
                .oauth2Login(Customizer.withDefaults())
                .build();
    }
----
At this point, the Angular application can explicitly intercept HTTP 401 responses
and trigger the authentication flow.

== ENSURING USER DATA PRIVACY
To ensure that order data is only
accessed by the users who created the entity(i.e orders). No user should be able to see the orders from another person.
 
There are a few different solutions for implementing this requirement in Spring.
We’ll follow these steps:

1. Add a custom query to OrderRepository to filter orders based on the user who
created them.
2. Update OrderService to use the new query instead of the default findAll().
3. Update OrderController to extract the username of the currently authenticated user from the security context and pass it to OrderService when asking
for orders. refer to chapter 17 of Spring Security in Action by Laurent¸iu Spilca˘
(Manning, 2020).

public interface OrderRepository extends ReactiveCrudRepository<Order, Long> {
    // Custom method to query only the orders created by the given user

----
Next we need to update the getAllOrders() method in OrderService to accept a
username as input and use the new query method provided by OrderRepository.
[source, java]
----
    // When requesting all orders, the response includes only those belonging to the
    // given user.
    public Flux<Order> getAllOrders(String userId) {
        return orderRepository.findAllByCreatedBy(userId);
    }
----
update the getAllOrders() method in OrderController
[source, java]
----
    // Autowires the JWT representing the currently authenticated user
    @GetMapping
    public Flux<Order> getAllOrders(@AuthenticationPrincipal Jwt jwt) {
        // Extracts the subject of the JWT and uses it as the user identifier
        /*
         * Since Order Service is configured with JWT authentication, the principal will
         * be of
         * type Jwt. We can use the JWT (an Access Token) to read the sub claim
         * containing the
         * username for which the Access Token was generated (the subject).
         * 
         */
        return orderService.getAllOrders(jwt.getSubject());
    }
