= Spring Data
:figures: 11-development/02-spring/02-data

The main problem with all the previous mechanisms of persistence is you don’t have 
the chance to access both types of databases, relational or non-relational. But Spring 
Data solves this problem, allowing you to access databases using repositories with an 
interface to do CRUD operations. Also, you can create concrete that implements the 
repository interfaces with the idea of doing specific operations not covered by the Spring 
Data framework. These repositories are available in almost all implementations to access 
databases to reduce the complexity of using multiple databases in the same application. 
There are basic repositories that you use to extend the functionality of your repositories. 
In particular, two are most relevant. CrudRepository has the basic operations for all the 
entities. PagingAndSortingRepository contains all the logic to obtain the information of 
one structure in a database using the criteria of pagination and sorting.

Spring Data provides common abstractions and patterns for accessing data,
making it straightforward to navigate the different modules dedicated to rela-
tional and non-relational databases.

image::{figures}/interaction between an application using Spring Data and a database.png[A driver configures the connection between the application and the database. Entities 
represent domain objects and can be stored and retrieved through a repository]

* The main elements in Spring Data are database drivers, entities, and repositories.
** Entities represent domain objects and can be stored and retrieved through a repository
(Java Database Connectivity API) in imperative/blocking applications or an
R2DBC driver in reactive/non-blocking applications. For non-relational data-
bases, each vendor has its own dedicated solution.
** Entities—Domain objects that are persisted in a database. They must contain a
field to uniquely identify each instance (a primary key) and can use dedicated
annotations to configure the mapping between Java objects and database entries.
** Repositories—The abstractions used for data storage and retrieval. Spring Data
provides basic implementations, which are further extended by each module to
provide features specific to the database in use.
* Spring Data JDBC is a framework that supports integrating Spring applications
with relational databases relying on a JDBC driver.
* Entities represent domain objects and can be managed by Spring Data JDBC as
immutable objects. They must have the field hosting the primary key annotated
with @Id.
* Spring Data lets you capture audit metadata whenever an entity is created or
updated. You can enable this feature with @EnableJdbcAuditing.
* Data repositories grant access to entities from the database. You need to define
an interface, and then Spring Data will generate the implementation for you.
* Depending on your requirements, you can extend one of the available
Repository interfaces provided by Spring Data, such as CrudRepository.
* In Spring Data JDBC, all mutating custom operations (create, update, delete)
should run in transactions.
* Use the @Transactional annotation to run operations in a single unit of work.
* You can run integration tests for the Spring Data JDBC slice using the @Data-
JdbcTest annotation.
* Environment parity is essential for the quality and reliability of your tests and
deployment pipeline.
* You can test the integration between your application and backing services
defined as containers by using the Testcontainers library. It lets you use light-
weight, throwaway containers in your integration tests.
* Database schemas are critical for applications. In production, you should use a
tool like Flyway, which provides version control for your database.
* Flyway should manage any database changes to ensure reproducibility, trace-
ability, and reliability.
*  Data sources are one of the primary causes of differences across environments. It’s
common practice to use an in-memory database while developing locally—something
like H2 or HSQL. But that affects the predictability and robustness of your applications.
Even if all relational databases speak the SQL language and Spring Data JDBC provides
generic abstractions, each vendor has its own dialect and unique features that make it
essential to use the same database in production that you use in development and test-
ing. Otherwise, you may not catch errors that might happen only in production.

== Repository Support
When you write an application that needs to persist/retrieve information from a 
database, you create a class or layer that contains all these operations in most cases. 
There are multiples ways to group these operations: all together in the same class, one 
class per table, but the most common way to do it is to create a class that represents the 
DAO pattern, which is discussed more in the next section, with all the operations of one 
table. This means that you can have multiple classes to access the database, where the 
main difference is the table you access. To reduce the complexity of having multiple classes with the same code, Spring Data offers the possibility to use an abstraction that 
contains all these operations, and you only need to indicate the name of the entity/table 
that you access.

Spring Data offers interfaces that provide common database operations. You need 
to create an interface that extends from one of that common interfaces and indicate 
which table or structure you want to access. Behind the scenes, Spring Data transforms 
this interface into one query to save/retrieve the information depending on the type of 
database.

== Spring Data JDBC vs Spring Data JPA
+
Spring Data offers two main options for integrating applications with a relational database over the JDBC driver: Spring Data JDBC and Spring Data JPA. How to choose
between the two? As always, the answer is that it depends on your requirements and
specific context.

*Spring Data JPA* (https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) is the most-used module in the Spring Data project. It's based on the Java Persistence API (JPA), a standard specification included in Jakarta EE (previously known as Java EE). Hibernate is the most popular implementation. It's a robust and battle-tested object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for managing data persistence in Java applications. Hibernate provides many useful features, but it's also a complex framework. If you're not aware of aspects like persistence context, lazy loading, dirty checking, or sessions, you might face issues that will be hard to debug without a sound familiarity with JPA and Hibernate. Once you know the framework better, you'll appreciate how much Spring Data JPA simplifies things and boosts your productivity.

*Spring Data JDBC* (https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc) is a more recent addition to the Spring Data family. It integrates with relational databases following the domain-driven design (DDD) concepts like aggregates, aggregate roots, and reposi-
tories. It's lightweight, simpler, and an excellent choice for microservices where
domains are usually defined as bounded contexts (another DDD concept). It gives
developers more control over SQL queries and allows the use of immutable entities.
Being a simpler alternative to Spring Data JPA, it's not a drop-in replacement for every scenario, since it doesn't provide all the features offered by JPA.

You should considering your requirements, and then deciding which module suits the specific scenario better.

* Spring Data offers a feature to initialize a data source at startup time. By default, you can use a schema.sql file to create a schema and a data.sql file to insert data in the newly created tables. Such files should be placed in the src/main/resources folder.
* Spring Data loads the schema.sql file only when using an embedded, in-memory database.FOr other DB, we need to enable the functionality explicitly.

* Hibernate, the foundation for Spring Data JPA, offers automatically generating schemas from the entities defined in Java.


== Connection pooling
Opening and closing database connections are relatively expensive operations, so you
don’t want to do that every time your application accesses data. The solution is connec-
tion pooling: the application establishes several connections with the database and
reuses them, rather than creating new ones for each data access operation. This is a
considerable performance optimization.

Spring Boot uses HikariCP for connection pooling, and you can configure it from
the application.yml file. You want to configure at least a connection timeout
(spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout) and a maximum number of con-
nections in the pool (spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size), because these
both affect application resilience and performance. As you saw for the Tomcat thread
pool, multiple factors influence which values you should use. As a starting point, you
can refer to the HikariCP analysis of pool sizing (https://github.com/brettwooldridge/
HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing).

    hikari:
    # The maximum time (ms) to spend waiting to get a connection from the pool
    connection-timeout: 2000 #ms
    # The maximum number of connections HikariCP will keep in the pool
    maximum-pool-size: 5
----

== Logging the database connection URL
When scaling up the number of microservices where each microservice connects to its own database, 
it can be hard to keep track of what database each microservice actually uses. To avoid this confusion, a good practice is to add a LOG statement directly after the startup of a microservice that logs connection information that is used to connect to the database.

== Defining repositories
Spring Data comes with a set of interfaces for defining repositories:

The CrudRepository interface provides standard methods for performing basic create, read, 
update, and delete operations on the data stored in the databases.
• The PagingAndSortingRepository interface adds support for paging and sorting to the 
CrudRepository interface.

== defining custom queries in Spring Data
There are two main options for defining custom queries in Spring Data:

=== Automatic Custom Queries
Defining query methods following a specific naming convention.

Spring Data JPA provides full support for read and write operations.
+
The structure of 
the query is split into two parts: the first one defines the subject of the query and the 
second one is the predicate. The subject of the query defines which type of operation 
the query needs to execute instead. The predicate is the attributes part of the clause that 
filters, orders, or is distinct.

+
|===
| Repository method building block | Examples

| Action
| find, exists, delete, count

| Limit
| One, All, First10

| -
| By

| Property expression
| findByIsbn, findByTitleAndAuthor, findByAuthorOrPrice

| Comparison
| findByTitleContaining, findByIsbnEndingWith, findByPriceLessThan

| Ordering operator
| orderByTitleAsc, orderByTitleDesc
|===
+
Following Table describes the most relevant subject keywords. Some of these keywords 
could not be supported for specific non-relational databases.
|===
| Keyword | Description
| findBy…

getBy…

queryBy…
| These keywords are generally associated with a select query and return an element or 
set of elements that can be a Collection or Streamable subtype.
| countBy… | Returns the number of elements that match the query.
| existBy… | Returns a boolean type with true if there is something that matches the query.
| deleteBy… | Removes a set of elements that matches the query but does not return anything.
|===
Following Table shows the equivalence between predicate keywords and the database 
keyword.
|===
| Logical Keyword | Keyword expressions
| LIKE | Like
| IS_NULL | Null or IsNull
| LESS_THAN | LessThan
| GREATER_THAN | GreaterThan
| AND | And
| OR | Or
| AFTER | After or IsAfter
| BEFORE | Before or IsBefore
|===
[,java]

  Optional<Book> findByIsbn(String isbn);

  boolean existsByIsbn(String isbn);
----
=== Manual Custom Queries
Using the @Query annotation to provide an SQL-like statement that will be executed by the method.
+
[,java]
----
  @Modifying
  @Transactional
  @Query("delete from Book where isbn = :isbn")
  void deleteByIsbn(String isbn);
----

There are many ways to declare a query:

• Declare it as constant at the top of the interface so that you have all 
the declarations of methods to understand each of them.
• Externalize all the queries into a properties file and import them 
dynamically into each repository. One of the cons of this approach 
is that you need to have a good organization to know which file 
contains the queries of each repository.
• Lastly, have a class that contains all the queries of a specific 
repository. This approach is useful when you have a lot of queries 
that are too long. You clear your repository to have only the methods 
in one place and all the queries in another place. Also, define naming 
patterns to identify the idea behind each query.

Why do you need to create a manual query if there is a way to do it automatically? 
- One answer is that you need to improve the performance of the query that Spring Data 
generates
- or you don’t need all the attributes of the table. You cover a specific scenario. 
This situation has the name of Projections. 
- Another answer is that the query is so 
complex that not exist keyword to express it. No rule explains all the potential scenarios 
when you need to use one mechanism instead of another.

=== Implementing Repository Methods(Custom Repository Implementations)
[source,java,attributes]
----
public interface CustomCurrencyJPARepository {
    List < Currency > myCustomFindMethod(String code);
}

@Repository
@Transactional
public class CustomCurrencyJPARepositoryImpl extends
CustomCurrencyJPARepository {
    // Include all the dependencies necessary to access the database
    List < Currency > myCustomFindMethod(String code) {
        //Here all the logic related to your custom method
    }
}
----
you must inject all the dependencies you need to 
access the database in the constructor. For example, in a relational database, you need to 
include EntityManager.

another approach exists in the 
middle between writing the entire query manually or delegating all the responsibility 
to create the query to Spring Data. The Criteria API offers a way to create queries in a 
programmatic way preventing errors in the syntaxis. To implement this approach, you 
must create a custom repository containing all the logic to create the query.
public interface CustomCurrencyJPARepository {
    List < Currency > myCustomFindMethod(String code);
}

[source,java,attributes]
----
@Repository
@Transactional
public class CustomCurrencyJPARepositoryImpl extends
CustomCurrencyJPARepository {
    EntityManager em;
    public CustomCurrencyRepositoryImpl(EntityManager em) {
        this.em = em;
    }
    List < Currency > myCustomFindMethod(String code) {
        CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();
        CriteriaQuery < Currency > cq = cb.createQuery(Currency.class);
        // You need to define the main entity
        Root < Currency > currency = cq.from(Currency.class);
        // Define all the conditions of the query
        Predicate codePredicate = cb.equal(currency.get("code"), code);
        //You can have more than one where clause
        cq.where(codePredicate);
        // Create the query and after that executed
        TypedQuery < Currency > query = em.createQuery(cq);
        return query.getResultList();
    }
}
----
The flow of this method is first to create a criteria builder responsible for creating the 
elements of the query. After that, you need to indicate which entity you want to obtain 
as part of the response, in this case, Currency. The next step is to define the root of the 
query: the table that appears in the FROM XXXX block in the SQL sentence. Also, you 
can include all the conditions the query needs to match using the predicate conditions, 
which do not necessarily need to be only one. You can create as many as you want. 
Lastly, you need to create the query and indicate which type of response you want, which 
could be a list or one element.
Chapter 3 Spring Data and Different Types of Persistence

=== specifications
For JPA, Spring Data offers another possibility to encapsulate all this logic to create 
the query using classes. The specifications are classes you can create to extend from the 
Specification interface, which encapsulates the logic of custom queries but does not 
create an implementation of a repository. This approach helps you only have interfaces 
representing the layer to access a database
== Data Auditing
The Spring Data libraries support auditing to track who created an entity and
who updated it last. You can enable this feature in both Spring Data JDBC and
Spring Data R2DBC by configuring an AuditorAware (or ReactiveAuditor-
Aware) bean to return the username of the currently authenticated user.

When data auditing is enabled, you can use the @CreatedBy and @LastModifiedBy
annotations to automatically inject the right values when a create or update
operation occurs.
