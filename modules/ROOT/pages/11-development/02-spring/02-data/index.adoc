Spring Data provides common abstractions and patterns for accessing data,
making it straightforward to navigate the different modules dedicated to rela-
tional and non-relational databases.

* The main elements in Spring Data are database drivers, entities, and repositories.
** Entities represent domain objects and can be stored and retrieved through a repository
(Java Database Connectivity API) in imperative/blocking applications or an
R2DBC driver in reactive/non-blocking applications. For non-relational data-
bases, each vendor has its own dedicated solution.
** Entities—Domain objects that are persisted in a database. They must contain a
field to uniquely identify each instance (a primary key) and can use dedicated
annotations to configure the mapping between Java objects and database entries.
** Repositories—The abstractions used for data storage and retrieval. Spring Data
provides basic implementations, which are further extended by each module to
provide features specific to the database in use.
* Spring Data JDBC is a framework that supports integrating Spring applications
with relational databases relying on a JDBC driver.
* Entities represent domain objects and can be managed by Spring Data JDBC as
immutable objects. They must have the field hosting the primary key annotated
with @Id.
* Spring Data lets you capture audit metadata whenever an entity is created or
updated. You can enable this feature with @EnableJdbcAuditing.
* Data repositories grant access to entities from the database. You need to define
an interface, and then Spring Data will generate the implementation for you.
* Depending on your requirements, you can extend one of the available
Repository interfaces provided by Spring Data, such as CrudRepository.
* In Spring Data JDBC, all mutating custom operations (create, update, delete)
should run in transactions.
* Use the @Transactional annotation to run operations in a single unit of work.
* You can run integration tests for the Spring Data JDBC slice using the @Data-
JdbcTest annotation.
* Environment parity is essential for the quality and reliability of your tests and
deployment pipeline.
* You can test the integration between your application and backing services
defined as containers by using the Testcontainers library. It lets you use light-
weight, throwaway containers in your integration tests.
* Database schemas are critical for applications. In production, you should use a
tool like Flyway, which provides version control for your database.
* Flyway should manage any database changes to ensure reproducibility, trace-
ability, and reliability.
*  Data sources are one of the primary causes of differences across environments. It’s
common practice to use an in-memory database while developing locally—something
like H2 or HSQL. But that affects the predictability and robustness of your applications.
Even if all relational databases speak the SQL language and Spring Data JDBC provides
generic abstractions, each vendor has its own dialect and unique features that make it
essential to use the same database in production that you use in development and test-
ing. Otherwise, you may not catch errors that might happen only in production.

== Spring Data JDBC or Spring Data JPA?
+
Spring Data offers two main options for integrating applications with a relational database over the JDBC driver: Spring Data JDBC and Spring Data JPA. How to choose
between the two? As always, the answer is that it depends on your requirements and
specific context.

*Spring Data JPA* (https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa) is the most-used module in the Spring Data project. It's based on the Java Persistence API (JPA), a standard specification included in Jakarta EE (previously known as Java EE). Hibernate is the most popular implementation. It's a robust and battle-tested object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for managing data persistence in Java applications. Hibernate provides many useful features, but it's also a complex framework. If you're not aware of aspects like persistence context, lazy loading, dirty checking, or sessions, you might face issues that will be hard to debug without a sound familiarity with JPA and Hibernate. Once you know the framework better, you'll appreciate how much Spring Data JPA simplifies things and boosts your productivity.

*Spring Data JDBC* (https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc) is a more recent addition to the Spring Data family. It integrates with relational databases following the domain-driven design (DDD) concepts like aggregates, aggregate roots, and reposi-
tories. It's lightweight, simpler, and an excellent choice for microservices where
domains are usually defined as bounded contexts (another DDD concept). It gives
developers more control over SQL queries and allows the use of immutable entities.
Being a simpler alternative to Spring Data JPA, it's not a drop-in replacement for every scenario, since it doesn't provide all the features offered by JPA.

You should considering your requirements, and then deciding which module suits the specific scenario better.

* Spring Data offers a feature to initialize a data source at startup time. By default, you can use a schema.sql file to create a schema and a data.sql file to insert data in the newly created tables. Such files should be placed in the src/main/resources folder.
* Spring Data loads the schema.sql file only when using an embedded, in-memory database.FOr other DB, we need to enable the functionality explicitly.

[,yml]
----
  spring:
      sql:
          init:
              mode: always

* Hibernate, the foundation for Spring Data JPA, offers automatically generating schemas from the entities defined in Java.

== Connection pooling
Opening and closing database connections are relatively expensive operations, so you
don’t want to do that every time your application accesses data. The solution is connec-
tion pooling: the application establishes several connections with the database and
reuses them, rather than creating new ones for each data access operation. This is a
considerable performance optimization.

Spring Boot uses HikariCP for connection pooling, and you can configure it from
the application.yml file. You want to configure at least a connection timeout
(spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout) and a maximum number of con-
nections in the pool (spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size), because these
both affect application resilience and performance. As you saw for the Tomcat thread
pool, multiple factors influence which values you should use. As a starting point, you
can refer to the HikariCP analysis of pool sizing (https://github.com/brettwooldridge/
HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing).

spring:
datasource:
    username: user
    password: password
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/polardb_catalog
    hikari:
    # The maximum time (ms) to spend waiting to get a connection from the pool
    connection-timeout: 2000 #ms
    # The maximum number of connections HikariCP will keep in the pool
    maximum-pool-size: 5

== defining custom queries in Spring Data
There are two main options for defining custom queries in Spring Data:

* Using the @Query annotation to provide an SQL-like statement that will be exe-
cuted by the method.
+
[,java]
----
  @Modifying
  @Transactional
  @Query("delete from Book where isbn = :isbn")
  void deleteByIsbn(String isbn);
----

* Defining query methods following a specific naming convention.
Spring Data JPA provides full support for read and write operations.

| Action
| find, exists, delete, count

| Comparison
| findByTitleContaining, findByIsbnEndingWith, findByPriceLessThan

| Ordering operator
| orderByTitleAsc, orderByTitleDesc
|===
+
[,java]
----
  Optional<Book> findByIsbn(String isbn);

  boolean existsByIsbn(String isbn);
----

== Data Auditing
The Spring Data libraries support auditing to track who created an entity and
who updated it last. You can enable this feature in both Spring Data JDBC and
Spring Data R2DBC by configuring an AuditorAware (or ReactiveAuditor-
Aware) bean to return the username of the currently authenticated user.

When data auditing is enabled, you can use the @CreatedBy and @LastModifiedBy
annotations to automatically inject the right values when a create or update
operation occurs.
