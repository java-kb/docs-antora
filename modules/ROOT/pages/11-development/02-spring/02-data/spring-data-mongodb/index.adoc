:figures: 11-development/02-spring/02-data/spring-data-mongodb

Spring Data JPA works with mutating objects, so you can't use Java
records. JPA entity classes must be marked with the @Entity annotation and
expose a no-args constructor. JPA identifiers are annotated with @Id and
@Version from the javax.persistence package instead of org.springframework.data.annotation.

== Defining persistent entities with Spring Data
=== Entity
Tables are a key element of databases. They are responsible for containing specific types of 
information, such as product data, users, or invoices. JPA offers a simple way to translate a Java 
class into a table in the database using different types of annotations. The most important are 
@Entity and @Table because both help JPA understand all the attributes inside the class that 
need to be persisted in a table. Another thing to consider with entities is the override of the 
hashCode and equals methods to prevent any conflicts with the object’s content.
[source,java,attributes]
----
----
The definition of the name in the @Table annotation is optional when the table’s 
name is the same in the database with the same letters in the lower or uppercase. In 
the @Entity annotation, this is not optional because the only way that Spring Data 
detects that the class has information that needs to persist. Still, it’s a good practice to 
indicate the name table in all cases because if you decide to change the class name, the 
application could not work, so with the definition of the table name, the class name is 
agnostic. You can change it for everything that you want.

Also, you can define the schema that contains the table because you can use multiple 
schemas in JPA. The most common use is to define only one schema for the entire group 
of tables.
[source,java,attributes]
----
----
Each entity needs to follow the rules to be considered valid:

• Each entity needs to have an attribute/class with the @Id annotation 
to indicate the primary key or the main attribute for search.
• The entities need to have a constructor without arguments that 
cannot be defined. JPA uses the default constructor that has all the 
Java classes, but if you create a constructor with an argument, you 
need to define it.
• The classes must not be declared final.
• All the attributes need to have a setter and getter. 
• Also, it is good 
practice to include overriding the hashCode and equals methods.
+ 
Define the hashCode and equals methods in all your entities because it helps 
you to know if two instances of an entity are identical, so refer to the same row of 
a table. If you don’t declare all the comparisons between two or more instances of 
an entity, compare the position in memory, which could be different. Each instance 
could have the same information.
When two objects have the same values and refer to the same row in a database, 
it is known as database identity

It is not a good practice to modify the value of the attribute that you declare as @Id  after you persist the first time because you could have problems with 
the cache mechanism that provides Spring Data and Hibernate behind the scenes. 

Another thing to consider is that @Id must have a value because you set the value when 
you create the object, or you delegate the responsibility to generate the value to the 
database using one of the key generators

=== Columns
After you declare the table’s name in your class, the next step is to declare the name and 
the type of each table column that matches each class attribute. Also, you can define 
each column’s length, minimum, and maximum and use these definitions to validate if 
the values in one particular instance are valid or not to persist. And if the column accepts 
null values or not.
To indicate the name, length, maximum, and minimum, whether it supports null 
values or not, JPA offers the @Column annotation, in which you can only use one type 
over each class attribute.

The name of the columns could be the same or not; for example, the 
timezone attribute in the table is declared differently.

[source,java,attributes]
----
----

If you want to declare a default value in the column, you can do it as 
the attribute enabled assigned a value in the declaration. Another 
option is to use the columnDefinition property with the specification 
of the default value.

The Default Value in the Attribute
[source,java,attributes]
----
----
The Default Value in the Annotation
[source,java,attributes]
----
----

The @ColumnDefinition annotation does the same, but it is directly connected 
with Hibernate. It's recommended always using the annotations that JPA provides 
because if Spring Data JPA uses another vendor in the future, parts of your 
code may no longer compile.

The length property is only valid with the columns that save a string. The 
columns are numeric, so you can indicate the minimum and maximum 
values that support using the annotations connected with Spring Validator.

The nullable property is valid only with the primitive’s wrappers.

Unlike relational databases, MongoDB does not offer the option to create constraints. Therefore, our only option is to create unique indexes. However, automatic index creation in Spring Data is turned off by default. Firstly, let’s go ahead and turn it on in our application.properties:

spring.data.mongodb.auto-index-creation=true

With that configuration, indexes will be created on boot time if they do not yet exist. But, we have to remember that we cannot create a unique index after we already have duplicate values. This would result in an exception being thrown during the startup of our application.

The @Indexed annotation allows us to mark fields as having an index. And since we configured automatic index creation, we won’t have to create them ourselves. By default, an index is not unique. Therefore, we have to turn it on via the unique property. Let’s see it in action by creating our first example:

[source,java,attributes]
----
@Document
public class Company {
    @Id
    private String id;

    private String name;

    @Indexed(unique = true)
    private String email;

    // getters and setters
}
----
Notice we can still have our @Id annotation, which is completely independent of our index. And that’s all we need to have a document with a unique field. As a result, if we insert more than one document with the same email, it will result in a DuplicateKeyException:
[source,java,attributes]
----
@Test
public void givenUniqueIndex_whenInsertingDupe_thenExceptionIsThrown() {
    Company a = new Company();
    a.setName("Name");
    a.setEmail("a@mail.com");

    companyRepo.insert(a);

    Company b = new Company();
    b.setName("Other");
    b.setEmail("a@mail.com");
    assertThrows(DuplicateKeyException.class, () -> {
        companyRepo.insert(b);
    });
}
----
This approach is useful when we want to enforce uniqueness but still have a unique ID field generated automatically.

=== Primitive Types
In Java, you can use the primitive type or the wrapper; for example, instead of using ``long``, you can use ``java.lang.Long``.

The following Table describes the basic correlations between the SQL types and Java types.
[source,attributes]
|===
| *ANSI SQL Type* | *Java Type*
| BIGINT | long, java.lang.Long
| BIT | boolean, java.lang.Boolean
| CHAR | char, java.lang.Character
| CHAR (e.g. ‘N’, ‘n’, ‘Y’, ‘y’) | boolean, java.lang.Boolean
| DOUBLE | double, java.lang.Double
| FLOAT | float, java.lang.Float
| INTEGER | int, java.lang.Integer
| INTEGER (e.g. 0 or 1) | boolean, java.lang.Boolean
| SMALLINT | short, java.lang.Short
| TINYINT | byte, java.lang.Byte
|===  
There is no rule about how a boolean type needs to be represented. Many databases 
use various types of columns, like BIT, BYTE, BOOLEAN, or CHAR, to refer to the 
boolean type

As a recommendation, try to use primitive wrappers (Double, Float, etc.) 
instead of primitive variables (double, float) when you have a column that allows 
null values because JPA vendors could have other behavior to try to map null 
values in a primitive variable (e.g., in Hibernate, a null value in the database could 
be translated into a 0 if the class has an int variable).

=== Character Types
When you need to represent a string with more than one character, there are many SQL 
types that you can use depending on the element size you need to save. 
The following Table shows 
the equivalence between the different SQL types and Java classes; many SQL types could 
use the same class.
[source,attributes]
|===  
| *ANSI SQL Type* | *Java Type*
| CLOB | String
| NCLOB | String
| CHAR | String
| VARCHAR | String
| LONGVARCHAR | String
| NCHAR | String
| NVARCHAR | String
| LONGNVARCHAR | String
|===

BLOB and CLOB are known as LOBs (large object types). Each has the 
responsibility to save something, but the main idea of both is to save large volumes of information. The following describes each of them.

• A BLOB (binary large object) stores binary files like videos, gifs, and 
audio files.
• A CLOB (character large object) stores large files that contain text 
like PDF documents, text files, and JSON files.
• Depending on the database, there are several formats; for example, 
in MySQL, type TEXT represents a CLOB.

=== Date and time types
If you need to save something connected with a date in a column, there are many SQL 
types and Java types depending on the precision you need to save it. The following Table shows 
the equivalence between the different date SQL types and Java classes; many SQL types 
could use the same class.

[cols="a,2a"]
|===
| *ANSI SQL Type* | *Java Type*
| DATE 
| 
* java.sql.Date
* java.time.LocalDate
* java.util.Date
* java.util.Calendar
| TIME | java.util.Date, java.sql.Time, java.time.OffsetTime
, java.time.LocalTime
| TIMESTAMP | java.util.Date,java.util.Calendar, java.time.Instant, java.sql.Timestamp, java.time.LocalDateTime
| TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE | java.time.OffsetDateTime, java.time.ZonedDateTime
| TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | java.time.LocalDateTime
| BIGINT | java.time.Duration
|===  

JPA 2.2 supports all the new classes in the java.time Java 8 package. It provides many 
new methods that previously existed in the Joda library. Still, if you use an old version of 
JPA, you can find in your code a conversion between java.sql.Date and java.util.Date.

=== Binary Types
When you need to save a large volume of data, like a book, video, audio, or photo, there 
are many formats in SQL Type to solve the situation. The following Table shows the equivalence 
between the different SQL types and Java classes.
|===
| *ANSI SQL Type* | *Java Type*
| VARBINARY | byte[], java.lang.Byte[], java.io.Serializable
| BLOB | java.sql.Blob
| CLOB | java.sql.Clob
| NCLOB | java.sql.Clob
| LONGVARBINARY | byte[], java.lang.Byte[]
|===

=== Other Types
Other types are not the group for criteria. In most cases, it is convenient to use it to 
reduce any conversion after obtaining the information from the database. The following Table
show some of the most relevant of SQL types and the equivalence with the Java classes.
|===
| *ANSI SQL Type* | *Java Type*
| NUMERIC | java.math.BigInteger, java.math.BigDecimal
| INTEGER, NUMERIC, SMALLINT, TINYINT, BIGINT, DECIMAL, DOUBLE, FLOAT, CHAR, LONGVARCHAR, VARCHAR | Enum
| VARCHAR | java.util.Currency, java.lang.Class, java.util.Locale, java.net.URL
|===
The enumeration could be saved as many types and mapped directly to an enum 
in the Java class. The explanation is that you can save the enumeration as a string or an 
ordinal type like a number and delegate to the framework the responsibility to transform 
a column’s information into a value of the enumeration

=== Non-Persistent Attributes
JPA offers the possibility to indicate attributes that do not need to be persisted in the 
database. It’s not the best practice, but there are many reasons to do it, for example, an 
old application with logic inside the entity.

To do this include the @Transient annotation over the attribute.
[source, java]
----
----

=== Primary Key and Generators
The primary key is one of the most discussed topics because there are many ways or 
approaches to decide which is the best type to use as a primary key. 

- Sometimes, the best 
option is to use a Long key because you save a short number of rows in the database. 
- On the other hand, you can have an entity with a huge number of rows, so a good option could use a UUID. Also, another reason to use a UUID is for security because if your application exposes an endpoint that gives all the information of an entity using the ID, you can increment or decrement the ID and obtain the rows of a table instead if you use a UUID reduces the risk that someone knows which are valid UUIDs that exist in the database.
+
Using a VARCHAR, which is the way to represent a UUID in the database, 
is less efficient than using a numerical type like BIGINT or INTEGER. Also, the 
numerical types use less space than VARCHAR.
If you use VARCHAR to save a UUID, consider the length of the column because 
sometimes this column has a small size. When you try to persist the information, 
an exception appears.

The id field is used to hold the database identity of each stored entity, corresponding to the primary 
key when using a relational database. We will delegate the responsibility of generating unique values 
for the id field to Spring Data. Depending on the database used, Spring Data can delegate this responsibility to the database engine or handle it on its own. In either case, the application code does 
not need to consider how a unique database id value is set. The id field is not exposed in the API, as 
a best practice from a security perspective. The fields in the model classes that identify an entity will 
be assigned a unique index in the corresponding entity class, to ensure consistency in the database 
from a business perspective.

After you select the primary key of an entity, the next thing to do is define the 
strategy to generate the value. To do this, you need to indicate over the declaration of attribute that acts as the primary key the @GeneratedValue annotation and indicates the generation mechanism. Doing this, JPA completes this value before persisting the entity.

[source,java,attributes]
----
----
There are many implementations of table generators to optimize and 
reduce the risk of collision. Examples include Hilo and Pooled optimizer, which 
is part of the Hibernate.

JPA offers many strategies to generate the primary key:

**GenerationType.SEQUENCE **

defines a numeric sequence in the 
database, so before persisting the information in the JPA table, call 
the sequence to obtain the next number to insert into the table. 
The main benefit of using the sequence is that you can use it in any 
column in multiple tables connected directly by one table, but it’s 
a common practice to use it for a specific purpose. Some databases 
that support the use of SEQUENCE are Oracle and PostgreSQL.

Depending on the database version, an alternative could be declared in the 
generator outside the table’s structure.

====
**GenerationType.IDENTITY** 

is a special behind-the-scenes column 
that does the same as the SEQUENCE check, which is the next 
available value. Some databases do not support the definition of a 
SEQUENCE, so they have an alternative special column like this that 
is an auto-incremented value.

[tabs]
====
PostgreSQL::
+
[source, sql]
----
----
Oracle::
+
[source, sql]
----
----
====
**GenerationType.TABLE** 

is an alternative approach when you have 
a database that does not support using SEQUENCE; for example, 
MySQL 5.7 and lower do not have it. The goal is to have a table in 
your schema containing one row per entity that needs to generate an 
ID, which is the next available value.


**GenerationType.AUTO** 

is a strategy that considers the database you 
used and defines which is the best option to use. You can indicate this 
strategy in the annotation or without anything @GeneratedValue()
because both cases indicate the same.

== optimistic locking

The version field is used to implement optimistic locking, allowing Spring Data to verify that updates of 
an entity in the database do not overwrite a concurrent update. If the value of the version field stored 
in the database is higher than the value of the version field in an update request, this indicates that 
the update is performed on stale data—the information to be updated has been updated by someone 
else since it was read from the database. Attempts to perform updates based on stale data will be prevented by Spring Data. 

=== Relationships
When you define the structure of your database, many tables have a relationship with 
others to reduce the number of redundant information. You can see the relationship 
between tables when you have a foreign key in one table and the primary key in another.
JPA has a set of annotations to declare the types of relationships between the entities. 
The relationship could be 

- unidirectional if you can access the information of both 
entities from one of them; for example, you have the information about the Currency of 
a Country but not vice versa; 
- in the other hand, exists a bidirectional relationship when 
you can navigate from any entity to the other one.

In all the types of relationships, you can indicate if you accept null values or 
not, which is a way to say that the column in the database could or couldn’t have a 
value. When you indicate this information in the relationship, it impacts the query 
that Hibernate generates to obtain the information. For example, in a @ManyToOne relation, if you allow null values, the query uses a LEFT JOIN instead, which indicates 
the opposite query contains an INNER JOIN. If you don’t indicate anything in the 
annotation, the column accepts null values.

==== Many To One
many 
entities reference one another; for example, many countries could 
have the same currency in the catalog’s application. Spring Data uses 
the foreign key in one table to join with the other; for example, the 
country’s table uses currency_id to join with the column id in the 
currency table. 
==== OneToMany
An alternative to Many To One is @OneToMany which is used when you try to 
have a bidirectional relationship, but in your tables, both types are the 
same. 

To do a bidirectional relationship, both entities need to have 
an attribute that refers to the other entity where one is @ManyToOne, 
and the other is @OneToMany.

==== OneToOne
One table 
has a foreign key associated with the table’s primary key without 
having the chance to refer to multiple rows. 

One problem with this type of relation is when you create a bidirectional relation, so both 
entities refer to the other with a non-null value. This could produce 
an exception because one entity needs that the other exists in the 
database, and vice versa is like a deadlock. To solve this problem, 
one of the entities needs to have the possibility to allow null values 
so you have a way to persist an entity and, after that, use it to put the 
reference in the other one.

==== ManyToMany 
is one of the most complex relationships. If you 
have previously worked with databases, you know that this type 
of relation implies creating an intermediate table that contains 
the primary key of both tables. In the JPA world, these three tables 
become two entities, and the specific implementation of JPA has the 
responsibility to understand how the query and hide or abstract how 
it is implemented in the database.

=== Lazy and Eager Loading
JPA offers a mechanism to reduce the number of data in memory until you need 
it. The way to do it is to add a property fetch in the annotation that indicates the 
relationship between both entities. The property has two potential values.

• *FetchType.LAZY* indicates the implementation of JPA that is not 
necessary to obtain the information of the relationship until someone 
invokes the attribute’s get method. Behind the scenes, Hibernate, in 
this case, inserts a proxy in the attribute representing the relationship 
which knows the query that needs to be executed to obtain the 
information. This approach spends less memory in the application 
and gives you a faster load of information; in the other hand, if you 
need to obtain always information about the relationship, the cost of 
executing the operation increases and takes more time.
• *FetchType.EAGER* indicates the JPA implementation that must 
obtain all the other entity’s information when executing the query. 
With this approach, you reduce the time to initialization because 
when you have one entity in memory, you have all the information; 
in the other hand, the query execution could take more time and 
negatively impact the application’s performance.

Both approaches have pros and cons related to performance. The standard is to use 
all the relationships with FetchType.LAZY to increase the application’s performance and 
explicitly obtain the information of the other entities.

=== prevent a recursive mapping
When you use MapStruct and do it automatically, the mapper from one object to another 
invokes all the get methods, so Spring Data suppose that you need all the information of the 
lazy collections. The main problem in this bidirectional relationship is that it produces an 
infinite loop, so you need to exclude the field country in the State entity. To solve this, you 
must modify the ApiMapper class and create a custom mapper

=== Ordering
When you have two or more connected entities, and one has another’s list of elements, JPA or Hibernate executes the query without considering the order. You have two options: 

- order the element in your application 
- or delegate to the database the responsibility to do it.

To indicate to JPA that the list of entities needs to be ordered for criteria, add the @OrderBy annotation with the column’s name
[tabs]
======
Cities API::
+
[tabs]
====
Country.java::
+
[source, java]
----
----
====
With this modification in the entity, when you get over the list of the entities, Spring Data executes a query with the ordering considering the column name that you indicate in the property value.
+
Hibernate: select states0_.country_id as country_5_2_0_, states0_.id as 
id1_2_0_, states0_.id as id1_2_1_, states0_.code as code2_2_1_, states0_.
country_id as country_5_2_1_, states0_.enabled as enabled3_2_1_, states0_.
name as name4_2_1_ from state states0_ where states0_.country_id=? *order by states0_.code*

======
Finally, this ordering approach always works in the same direction, so if you need different criteria to order the entities, the best solution is to define a custom query in the repository that receives the type of ordering as a parameter.

=== Entity Inhertitance
Like many object-oriented languages, Java offers the possibility to use inherence to 
reduce duplicate code and extend the functionality of other classes. JPA is not agnostic of 
this feature and offers several possibilities to reduce the complexity of your application’s 
domain in Java code. Behind the scenes, in your database, the complexity could be the 
same as if you don’t use the inherence.

==== Mapped Superclass
moving the ID to a superclass is known as 
a mapped superclass. All the attributes of the abstract class (a requisite of the mapped 
superclass) are not considered for Spring Data as an entity per se. All attributes of the 
abstract class are parts of other entities using inherence. But in the database, you see all 
the columns in the same table

Let’s go back to our catalog’s application to see a common problem. All the entities 
have an attribute ID with the same strategy of generating the value, so it’s not something 
good to have duplicated in a lot of places this element. To reduce the duplicate code, 
let’s create a Base class that contains the id attribute with the annotation to generate the 
value

to change the name of one attribute of the concrete class without changing anything more. JPA offers the possibility 
to override certain attributes of the abstract class indicating the new values; for example, 
let’s change the name of the ID in the Currency entity to another value.

==== Table per Class Hierarchy
This approach represents an entire hierarchy of classes inside a single table. An 
alternative name for this strategy is single table. JPA uses this strategy as the default if 
you don’t indicate anything explicitly using the @Inheritance annotation.

A table per class hierarchy implies that you need to add an extra column in the 
tables of the database which not appear in your entities because JPA needs to know to 
discriminate if the information of one row is from one class to another.

Let’s introduce a few modifications to your catalog’s applications to represent this 
specific situation. A new set of entities appear in Figure 4-8, representing that you can 
have cities and airports that are not directly connected. Both entities extend from the 
Base class, which no longer has the @MappedSuperclass annotation.
+
//image::{figures}/Entity-Inhertitance-Table-per-Class-Hierarchy-Cities-API[New entities with single table relationship]
+
There are only two tables because the city and airport are part of one class and the 
BASE_TYPE column works as a discriminator to know which type of entity represents 
one row in the database. Remember that the code and name attributes are unique in the 
different tables.

There are drawbacks to using this strategy; for example, you have several rows that 
only have columns with the information the other ones have null, so in a way, you 
lose all the constraints about not null values. Another problem is connected with the 
normalization of the information, which could impact the performance of the queries 
because there are many attributes. You decide which are relevant to introduce an index 
and which are not relevant.
This strategy introduces problems in the long term for stability, performance, and 
maintainability, so it’s not recommended to use, at least in the new system.

=== Table per Subclass with Joins
This strategy is an alternative to the “table per class” hierarchy to solve the problem of having 
all the information with many rows with null columns in one table. To solve the problem of 
the previous strategy, this one produces a table per each concrete class of the hierarchy. You 
can directly access any of the entities using the repositories that provide Spring Data.

Following the previous example that introduces modifications to your catalog’s 
application to represent a hypothetical situation, let’s introduce a little variation in the 
previous scenario to generate one table per class. Figure 4-9 shows the relationship between tables and the classes with this type of 
relationship.
+
//image::{figures}/Entity-Inhertitance-Table-per-Subclass-Hierarchy-Cities-API.png[]
+
There are the same number of classes that entities exist in the catalog’s model where 
the City and the Airport ID has the same value as the Base table’s primary key. To access 
the information implies a join between two tables. For example, if you want to access the 
information of a particular city, you create a repository as always, but behind the scenes, 
make a request to the Base table and join the City table.
+
[tabs]
====
Base.java::
+
[source, java]
----

+
The next step is to modify the Airport class to include the attribute to do the joins 
between tables using the ``@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn`` annotation. This annotation is not 
required because JPA infers that both tables use the same ID, but if you want to use the ``@AttributeOverride`` annotation, it’s necessary to declare the name of the column.

The advantage of this approach is that 

- you must normalize the database and reduce 
the number of columns with null values, allowing the use of NOT NULL validations.

The disadvantage is that 

- you must join between tables to obtain all the information, 
which could be a big pain if you have many records. 
- Also, this problem appears when 
you insert or update the rows in this type of table because two sentences are executed 
per operation. 
- Another problem with this strategy is manually writing the repository 
queries because they are more complex.

=== Table per Class
One of the problems of the previous strategy implies that you need to do a join to obtain 
all the information; in the table per class strategy, you have the information duplicate 
between the main entity and the inherited classes. You can access the information of 
both entities, in this case, Base or Airport/City, without doing a join between tables. This 
is one of the approaches that does not imply many things to do in your entities. Use the 
@Inheritance annotation with the InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS value in the 
top class. The Inherit classes do not need to include anything; they just extend from the 
Base class.

Following the previous example, let’s do modifications by moving the “enabled” 
column to the Base class to have a scenario that gives you a better idea of what happens 
in both worlds, the database, and the catalog’s application
+
//image::{figures}/Entity-Inhertitance-Table-per-Class--Cities-API.png[]
+
The City and Airport tables have the same attributes—ID and ENABLED—in all the 
entities. You save information in the Base table, and one of the tables extends from it. 
This reduces the complexity. In the classes, the modifications are simple. You need to 
write the type of inheritance strategy in the Base class and anything else.

With this approach, you can create a repository per each table and access the specific 
information in each entity you want.

One of the cons of this strategy is that you have a lot of information duplicated in 
different tables. When doing a read operation like a select, you reduce the number of 
queries or joins necessary to obtain all the information. On the other hand, you need 
to execute a write operation like INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE implies that you need to 
modify two tables to maintain the consistency of the database. All these considerations 
are valid. You access directly to the entity’s repository.

=== Embeddable Class
All the previous ways of inherence imply that one class inherits from another one to 
reduce the duplicate code and model the system in a simpler way to understand. The 
embeddable class changes the paradigm because you can include a class in another, like 
an attribute but appear as part of the same table in the database.

The first thing to do is create a new class that contains two attributes to audit when a 
new row is created in the database and when suffering a modification. The class needs to 
have the @Embeddable annotation, which means that it is not an entity per se because it 
lives inside another class using the composition.

This approach offers a way to reuse a class, including many entities, without using 
the inherence. Inside the application, you see the classes as a composition, so you can 
split or show the model differently.

== creating the database schema
Hibernate, the foundation for Spring Data JPA, offers an interesting
feature for automatically generating schemas from the entities defined in
Java. it’s better to create
and evolve relational resources with a more sophisticated tool, like Flyway or Liquibase,
which will let you version-control your database.

== Enabling and configuring JPA auditing

When persisting data, it's useful to know the creation date for each row in a table and
the date when it was updated last. After securing an application with authentication
and authorization, you can even register who created each entity and recently updated
it. All of that is called database auditing.

In Spring Data JPA, you would use the @EnableJpaAuditing annota-
tion to enable JPA auditing, and you would annotate the entity class with
@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class) to make it listen to audit
events, which doesn’t happen automatically as in Spring Data JDBC.

Spring Data provides convenient annotations that we can use on dedicated fields to capture the information from such events (audit
metadata) and store it in the database as part of the entity.
