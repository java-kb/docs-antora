= Spring Data JDBC
:figures: 11-development/02-spring/02-data/spring-data-jdbc

Spring Data JDBC encourages working with immutable entities. Using Java records to
model entities is an excellent choice, since they're immutable by design and expose
an all-args constructor that the framework can use to populate objects.

== Enabling and configuring JDBC 
. Add dependencies
  dependencies {
  ...
  implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc'
  runtimeOnly 'org.postgresql:postgresql'
  }

  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
  </dependency>

. Configuring the connection to a database using JDBC

  spring:
    datasource:
      username: user
      password: password
      url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/polardb_catalog
      hikari:
        # The maximum time (ms) to spend waiting to get a connection from the pool
        connection-timeout: 2000 #ms
        # The maximum number of connections HikariCP will keep in the pool
        maximum-pool-size: 5

== Defining persistent entities with Spring Data
Depending on the business domain and its complexity, you might
want to distinguish the domain entity from the persistent entity, making the domain
layer utterly independent of the persistence layer. If you’d like to explore how to
model that scenario, I recommend referring to domain-driven design and hexagonal
architecture principles.

Spring Data JDBC encourages working with immutable entities. Using Java records to
model entities is an excellent choice, since they’re immutable by design and expose
an all-args constructor that the framework can use to populate objects.

A persistent entity must have a field that acts as the identifier for the object, which
will translate to the primary key in the database. You can mark a field as an identifier
with the @Id annotation (from the org.springframework.data.annotation pack-
age). The database is responsible for generating a unique identifier for each created
object automatically.

Some domaind like books are uniquely identified by an ISBN, which we can call a natural
key (or business key) for the domain entity. We could decide to use it also as the
primary key or introduce a technical key (or surrogate key). There are pros and
cons to both approaches. We can chose to use a technical key to make it easier to
manage and to decouple domain concerns from persistence implementation
details.

    // For convenience, let’s add a static factory method to the Book record for
    // building an object by passing only the business fields.

    public static Book of(String isbn, String title, String author, Double price, String publisher) {
        return new Book(null, isbn, title, author, price, publisher, null, null, 0);
    }

}
----
As a persistent entity, the Book record will be automatically mapped to relational
resources. Class and field names are transformed into lowercase, and the camel case is
translated into words joined by underscores. The Book record will result in the book
table, the title field will result in the title column, the price field will result in theprice column, and so on.

== Optimistic locking
It’s also OK when a single user updates an existing Entity object in isolation. But what happens if the same entity
is updated by multiple users concurrently? Spring Data JDBC supports optimistic locking
to address that concern. Users can read data concurrently. When a user attempts an
update operation, the application checks if there has been any change since the last
read. If there was, the operation is not performed, and an exception is thrown. The
check is based on a numeric field that starts counting from 0 and automatically
increases at every update operation. You can mark such a field with the @Version
annotation (from the org.springframework.data.annotation package).

When the @Id field is null and the @Version field is 0, Spring Data JDBC assumes
it’s a new object. Consequently, it relies on the database to generate an identifier
when inserting the new row in the table. When values are provided, it expects to find
the object in the database already and to update it.
== CREATING THE DATABASE SCHEMA
The database must have a table defined in DB for the mapping to
work. Spring Data offers a feature to initialize a data source at startup time. By default,
you can use a schema.sql file to create a schema and a data.sql file to insert data in the
newly created tables. Such files should be placed in the src/main/resources folder.

That is a convenient feature, and it’s useful for demos and experiments. However, it’s
too limited for use in production. it’s better to create
and evolve relational resources with a more sophisticated tool, like Flyway or Liquibase,
which will let you version-control your database.

----
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS book; 
CREATE TABLE book (
 id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, 
 author varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 isbn varchar(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
 price float8 NOT NULL,
 title varchar(255) NOT NULL, 
 version integer NOT NULL 
);
----
By default, Spring Data loads the schema.sql file only when using an embedded, in-
memory database. When using Other DB, we need to enable the functionality
explicitly. In the application.yml file for your service project, add the follow-
ing configuration to initialize the database schema from the schema.sql file.

== Enabling and configuring JDBC auditing

When persisting data, it's useful to know the creation date for each row in a table and
the date when it was updated last. After securing an application with authentication
and authorization, you can even register who created each entity and recently updated
it. All of that is called database auditing.

With Spring Data JDBC, you can enable auditing for all the persistent entities
using the @EnableJdbcAuditing annotation on a configuration class.

[,java]
----
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.data.jdbc.repository.config.EnableJdbcAuditing;

@Configuration
@EnableJdbcAuditing
public class DataConfig {
}
----

Spring Data provides convenient annotations that we can use on dedicated fields to capture the information from such events (audit
metadata) and store it in the database as part of the entity.

[,java]
----
@CreatedDate
private Instant createdDate;

@LastModifiedDate
private Instant lastModifiedDate;
----

== Data repositories with Spring Data

The repository pattern provides an abstraction for accessing data independently of its
source.

When using Spring Data repositories, your responsibility is limited to defining an
interface. At startup time, Spring Data will generate an implementation for your interface on the fly.


== Defining transactional contexts

The repositories provided by Spring Data come configured with transactional con-
texts for all the operations. For example, all methods in CrudRepository are transac-
tional. That means you can safely call the saveAll() method, knowing that it will be
executed in a transaction.

When you add your own query methods, it's up
to you to define which ones should be part of a transaction. You can rely on the
declarative transaction management provided by the Spring Framework and use
the @Transactional annotation (from the org.springframework.transaction
.annotation package) on classes or methods to ensure they are executed as part of
a single unit of work.

@Modifying
@Transactional
@Query("delete from Book where isbn = :isbn")
void deleteByIsbn(String isbn);
