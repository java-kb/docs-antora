== Debugging Standard Java

== Debugging Spring Boot Applications


== Debugging Spring Boot containers

When running a Spring Boot application as standard Java from your IDE, you can
specify whether you want to run it in debug mode. If you do, the IDE will attach a
debugger to the local Java process running your application. However, when you run
it from within a container, your IDE canâ€™t do that anymore because the process is not
running on the local machine.

you need to instruct the JVM inside the container to listen for debug connections on a specific port

=== Docker

=== Buildpacks

The container image produced by Paketo Buildpacks supports dedicated environment variables for running the application in debug mode (BPL_DEBUG_ENABLED and BPL_DEBUG_PORT). Then you
need to expose the debug port outside the container so that your IDE can reach it.
