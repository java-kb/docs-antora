== Generate a Spring Boot Application Using CLI
Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the development of Spring applications by providing a set of conventions and defaults. It allows developers to create stand-alone, production-grade applications with minimal configuration.
You can generate a Spring Boot application using the Spring CLI by running the following command:
[source, bash]
----
spring init --dependencies=web,data-jpa,h2,devtools myapp
----
== Generate a Spring Boot Application Using Curl
[source, bash]
----
curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -d groupId=com.polarbookshop -d artifactId=edge-service -d name=edge-service -d packageName=com.polarbookshop.edgeservice -d dependencies=web,data-jpa,h2,devtools -d javaVersion=17 -d bootVersion=3.3.0 -d type=maven-project -o edge-service.zip
----
change type=maven-project to type=gradle-project if you want to generate a Gradle project.
== Generate a Spring Boot Application Using JBang
[source, bash]
----
jbang init --name=myapp --dependencies=web,data-jpa,h2,devtools
cd myapp
jbang run
----

== Generate a Spring Boot Application Using Maven
[source, bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=myapp -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
cd myapp
mvn spring-boot:run
----
== Generate a Spring Boot Application Using Gradle
[source, bash]  
----
gradle init --type java-application
cd myapp
./gradlew bootRun
----
== Generate a Spring Boot Application Using IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and select "New Project". 
2. Choose "Spring Initializr" from the left panel.
3. Fill in the project details such as Group, Artifact, Name, and Description.
4. Select the dependencies you want to include, such as "Spring Web", "Spring Data JPA", "H2 Database", and "Spring Boot DevTools".
5. Click "Finish" to create the project.
6. IntelliJ IDEA will generate the project structure and download the necessary dependencies.
7. You can then run the application by right-clicking on the main class (annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`) and selecting "Run".

== Generate a Spring Boot Application Using Eclipse
1. Open Eclipse and select "File" -> "New" -> "Other".
2. Choose "Spring Starter Project" from the list.
3. Fill in the project details such as Group, Artifact, Name, and Description.
4. Select the dependencies you want to include, such as "Spring Web", "Spring Data JPA", "H2 Database", and "Spring Boot DevTools".
5. Click "Finish" to create the project.
6. Eclipse will generate the project structure and download the necessary dependencies.
7. You can then run the application by right-clicking on the main class (annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`) and selecting "Run As" -> "Java Application".

== Generate a Spring Boot Application Using Visual Studio Code
1. Open Visual Studio Code and install the "Spring Boot Extension Pack" from the Extensions Marketplace.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette.
3. Type "Spring Initializr" and select "Spring Initializr: Generate a Maven Project" or "Spring Initializr: Generate a Gradle Project".
4. Fill in the project details such as Group, Artifact, Name, and Description.
5. Select the dependencies you want to include, such as "Spring Web", "Spring Data JPA", "H2 Database", and "Spring Boot DevTools".
6. Click "Generate" to create the project.
7. Visual Studio Code will generate the project structure and download the necessary dependencies.
8. You can then run the application by opening the main class (annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`) and clicking the "Run" button in the top right corner or by using the terminal command `./mvnw spring-boot:run` or `./gradlew bootRun   
`.  

== Generate a Spring Boot Application Using Spring Initializr
Spring Initializr is a web-based tool that allows you to generate a Spring Boot application with the desired dependencies and configurations. You can access it at [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/).

1. Open your web browser and go to [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/).
2. Fill in the project metadata such as Group, Artifact, Name, Description, and Package Name.
3. Select the desired dependencies by searching for them or selecting from the list. For example, you can add "Spring Web", "Spring Data J  PA", "H2 Database", and "Spring Boot DevTools".
4. Choose the project type (Maven or Gradle) and the Java version you want to use.
5. Click the "Generate" button to download a ZIP file containing the generated Spring Boot application.
6. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location.       
7. Open the project in your preferred IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code).
8. You can then run the application by executing the main class (annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`) or using the terminal command `./mvnw spring-boot:run` or `./gradlew bootRun`.
