= Spring Testing
:figures: 11-development/02-spring/07-testing

Automated tests are paramount to producing high-quality software. One of the goals
for adopting a cloud native approach is speed. It’s impossible to move quickly if the
code is not adequately tested in an automated fashion, let alone to implement a con-
tinuous delivery process.

As a developer, you’ll usually implement a feature, deliver it, and then move on to
a new one, possibly refactoring the existing code. Refactoring code is risky, since you
might break some existing functionality. Automated tests reduce the risk and encour-
age refactoring, because you know that a test will fail, should you break something.

You shouldn’t aim to reach maximum test coverage
but rather to write meaningful tests. For example, writing tests for standard getters
and setters doesn’t make sense.

Automated tests assert that new features work as intended and that you haven’t
broken any existing functionality. This means that automated tests work as regression
tests. You should write tests to protect your colleagues and yourself from making mis-
takes. What to test and how in-depth to test is driven by the risk associated with a spe-
cific piece of code. 

One way of classifying software tests is defined by the Agile Testing Quadrants
model. The quadrants classify software tests based on whether they are technology or
business-facing and whether they support development teams or are used to critique
the product.

Following continuous delivery practices, we should aim at achieving fully automated
tests in three out of four quadrants,

== Test-driven development (TDD)
An essential practice of continuous delivery is test-driven development (TDD), which
helps achieve the goal of delivering software quickly, reliably, and safely. The idea is to
drive software development by writing tests before implementing the production
code.
