= Spring Testing
:figures: 11-development/02-spring/07-testing

Automated tests are paramount to producing high-quality software. One of the goals
for adopting a cloud native approach is speed. It’s impossible to move quickly if the
code is not adequately tested in an automated fashion, let alone to implement a continuous delivery process.

As a developer, you’ll usually implement a feature, deliver it, and then move on to
a new one, possibly refactoring the existing code. Refactoring code is risky, since you
might break some existing functionality. Automated tests reduce the risk and encourage refactoring, because you know that a test will fail, should you break something.

You shouldn’t aim to reach maximum test coverage
but rather to write meaningful tests. For example, writing tests for standard getters
and setters doesn’t make sense.

Automated tests assert that new features work as intended and that you haven’t
broken any existing functionality. This means that automated tests work as regression
tests. You should write tests to protect your colleagues and yourself from making mistakes. What to test and how in-depth to test is driven by the risk associated with a specific piece of code. 

One way of classifying software tests is defined by the Agile Testing Quadrants
model. The quadrants classify software tests based on whether they are technology or
business-facing and whether they support development teams or are used to critique
the product.

image::{figures}/Agile Testing Quadrants model.png[The Agile Testing Quadrants model is helpful in planning a software testing strategy]

Following continuous delivery practices, we should aim at achieving fully automated
tests in three out of four quadrants,

== Test-driven development (TDD)
An essential practice of continuous delivery is test-driven development (TDD), which
helps achieve the goal of delivering software quickly, reliably, and safely. The idea is to
drive software development by writing tests before implementing the production
code. 

With TDD, there’s a toolkit for the different ways to write our tests:
* Given-When-Then (GWT)
+
The Given is setting the stage, such as where everything’s at before the action
starts. Then you hit the When stage, the main event that gets things rolling. And
you wrap up with Then, where you spell out what you expect to happen after the
dust settles. It’s like telling a story of what your code will carry out.
* Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)
+
This is similar to GWT. But GWT tends to be more narrative and user-centric,
making it ideal for collaboration among developers, testers, and nontechnical
stakeholders. AAA, on the other hand, is more about the technical execution of
the test itself.
* Setup-Exercise-Verify-Teardown (SEVT)
+
This is your go-to when you’re in the trenches of integration and systems testing.
You start with Setup, where you prep your testing ground. Then, you jump into
Exercise, where you run your system through its paces. After this, you go to Ver‐
ify, which is where you play detective to confirm everything worked out. And
don’t forget the Teardown. This is the cleanup step that’s essential to keeping
everything neat for next time

== Testing APIs manually
=== Testing locally
we can test API manually by performing the following steps:

1. Build and start the microservices as background processes.
+
    cd $BOOK_HOME/Chapter03/2-basic-rest-services/
    ./gradlew build
+
Once the build completes, we can launch our microservices as background processes to the Terminal
process with the following code:
+
gradle
+
    java -jar microservices/product-composite-service/build/libs/*.jar &
    java -jar microservices/product-service/build/libs/*.jar &
    java -jar microservices/recommendation-service/build/libs/*.jar &
    java -jar microservices/review-service/build/libs/*.jar &
+
maven
+
2. Use curl to call the composite API.
    curl http://localhost:7000/product-composite/1 -s | jq .
+
[source,console,attributes]
----
# Verify that a 404 (Not Found) error is returned for a non-existing productId
(13)
curl http://localhost:7000/product-composite/13 -i
# Verify that no recommendations are returned for productId 113
curl http://localhost:7000/product-composite/113 -s | jq .
# Verify that no reviews are returned for productId 213
curl http://localhost:7000/product-composite/213 -s | jq .
# Verify that a 422 (Unprocessable Entity) error is returned for a productId
that is out of range (-1)
curl http://localhost:7000/product-composite/-1 -i
# Verify that a 400 (Bad Request) error is returned for a productId that is not
a number, i.e. invalid format
curl http://localhost:7000/product-composite/invalidProductId -i
----
+
3. Stop the microservices.
+
Finally, you can shut down the microservices with the following command:
    kill $(jobs -p)
+
If you are using an IDE such as Visual Studio Code with Spring Tool Suite, you can use their support
for the Spring Boot Dashboard to start and stop your microservices with one click.

Microservices with Spring Boot 3 and Spring Cloud::

Now, we have everything in place to test the microservices together. We will build new Docker images 
and start up the system landscape using Docker Compose based on the Docker images. Next, we will 
use the Swagger UI viewer to run some manual tests. Finally, we will use the database CLI tools to see 
what data was inserted into the databases.
Build and start the system landscape with the following command:
[source,console,attributes]
----
cd $BOOK_HOME/Chapter06
./gradlew build && docker-compose build && docker-compose up
----
Open Swagger UI in a web browser, http://localhost:8080/openapi/swagger-ui.html, and perform 
the following steps on the web page:
+
1. Click on the ProductComposite service and the POST method to expand them.
2. Click on the Try it out button and go down to the body field.
3. Replace the default value, 0, of the productId field with 123456.
4. Scroll down to the Execute button and click on it.
5. Verify that the returned response code is 200.
+
We can also use the database CLI tools to see the actual content in the different databases.
Look up the content in the product service, that is, the products collection in MongoDB, with the 
following command:
[source,console,attributes]
----
docker-compose exec mongodb mongosh product-db --quiet --eval "db.products.find()"
----
Look up the content in the recommendation service, that is, the recommendations collection in MongoDB, with the following command:
[source,console,attributes]
----
docker-compose exec mongodb mongosh recommendation-db --quiet --eval "db.recommendations.find()"
----
Look up the content in the review service, that is, the reviews table in MySQL, with the following 
command:
[source,console,attributes]
----
docker-compose exec mysql mysql -uuser -p review-db -e "select * from reviews"
----
The mysql CLI tool will prompt you for a password; you can find it in the docker-compose.yml file.

== Adding semi-automated tests of a microservice landscape
Being able to automatically run unit and integration tests for each microservice in isolation using
plain Java, JUnit, and Gradle is very useful during development, but insufficient when we move over
to the operation side. In operation, we also need a way to automatically verify that a system landscape of
cooperating microservices delivers what we expect. Being able to, at any time, run a script that verifies
that a number of cooperating microservices all work as expected in operation is very valuable – the
more microservices there are, the higher the value of such a verification script.

We can create a simple bash script that can verify the functionality of a deployed system
landscape by performing calls to the RESTful APIs exposed by the microservices. It is based on the
curl commands we learned about and used above. The script verifies return codes and parts of the
JSON responses using jq. The script contains two helper functions, assertCurl() and assertEqual(),
to make the test code compact and easy to read.

== Automating tests of cooperating microservices

Docker Compose is really helpful when it comes to manually managing a group of microservices.
In this section, we will take this one step further and integrate Docker Compose into our test script,
test-em-all.bash. The test script will automatically start up the microservice landscape, run all the
required tests to verify that the microservice landscape works as expected, and finally, tear it down,
leaving no traces behind.

Before the test script runs the test suite, it will check for the presence of a start argument in the
invocation of the test script. If found, it will restart the containers with the following code:
[source,bash,attributes]
----
if [[ $@ == *"start"* ]]
then
  echo "Restarting the test environment..."
  echo "$ docker compose down --remove-orphans"
  docker compose down --remove-orphans
  echo "$ docker compose up -d"
  docker compose up -d
fi
----
After that, the test script will wait for the product-composite service to respond with OK:
[source,bash,attributes]
----
waitForService http://$HOST:${PORT}/product-composite/1
----
The waitForService function sends HTTP requests to the supplied URL using curl. Requests are sent
repeatedly until curl responds that it got a successful response back from the request. The function
waits 3 seconds between each attempt and gives up after 100 attempts, stopping the script with a failure.

Next, all the tests are executed as they were previously. Afterward, the script will tear down the landscape if it finds the stop argument in the invocation parameters:

The test script has also changed the default port from 7000, which we used when we ran the microservices without Docker, to 8080, which is used by our Docker containers.

The automated tests of the microservice landscape, test-em-all.bash, need to be updated so that 
they ensure that the database of each microservice has a known state before it runs the tests.
The script is extended with a setup function, setupTestdata(), which uses the composite create and 
delete APIs to set up test data used by the tests.

It uses a helper function, recreateComposite(), to perform the actual requests to the delete and 
create APIs:
The setupTestdata function is called directly after the waitForService function:
  waitForService curl -X DELETE http://$HOST:$PORT/product-composite/13
  setupTestdata
The main purpose of the waitForService function is to verify that all microservices are up and running.

After running these tests, we can move on to see how to troubleshoot tests that fail.

1. First, check the status of the running microservices with the following command:
+
  docker-compose ps
+
If all the microservices are up and running and healthy, the status will be running
2. If any of the microservices do not have a status of Up, check their log output for any errors by
using the docker-compose logs command. For example, you would use the following command if you wanted to check the log output for the product service:
+
  docker-compose logs product
+
If required, you can restart a failed container with the docker-compose restart command.
For example, you would use the following command if you wanted to restart the product microservice:
+
  docker-compose restart product
+
If a container is missing, for example, due to a crash, you start it up with the docker-compose
up -d --scale command. For example, you would use the following command for the product
microservice:
+
  docker-compose up -d --scale product=1
+
If errors in the log output indicate that Docker is running out of disk space, parts of it can be
reclaimed with the following command:
+
  docker system prune -f --volumes
+
3. Once all the microservices are up and running and healthy, run the test script again, but without starting the microservices:
+
  ./test-em-all.bash
+
The tests should now run fine!
