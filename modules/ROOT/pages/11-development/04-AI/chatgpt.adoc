= ChatGPT development
:figures: 11-development/04-AI

ChatGPT is a prompt-based Generative AI that engages the user in a dialogue 
that helps them explore ideas to aid in the design and development of entire proj-
ects. In addition, ChatGPT artfully generates documentation for each method it 
writes.

ChatGPT (as of this writing) does not support development within an IDE. How-
ever, unlike GitHub Copilot and AWS CodeWhisperer, it can produce entire 
projects and easily translate code from one programming language to another. 
Copilot and CodeWhisperer take hints from your comments to infer what code 
you want to write. With ChatGPT, you explicitly write prompts that ChatGPT uses 
to create the code.
