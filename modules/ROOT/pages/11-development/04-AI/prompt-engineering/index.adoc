AI-assisted programming tools are crafted to enhance developers’ abilities, enabling
them to zero in on advanced problem solving and innovations instead of being
ensnared in monotonous tasks or complex code details. This is why GitHub’s use of
the word copilot is spot on. It’s about having that reliable buddy in the cockpit, navi‐
gating through the intricate and often tedious aspects of coding, allowing you to focus
on what matters.

== Evaluation of AI-Assisted Programming Tools
* You’ve got to weigh many factors like its precision, chat features, security, speed, and user-friendliness.
* get recommendations from other developers. 
* Plus, it’s a good idea to test drive a few yourself. Luckily, most of these tools offer free trials, so you can give them a whirl without committing right off the bat.
* Another key aspect to consider is the company’s financial backing. Does it have venture capital funding? Without this, a company might struggle not just to grow but also to keep its platform innovative. 


Let’s look at a simple example. For this, we’ll use ChatGPT, which has a robust ability
to gin up code. We will use a prompt to ask what we want the system to do. Suppose
we give it the following prompt:
Prompt: In Python, write a program that checks if a given integer is even or odd and
print the result.

[source,python,attributes]
----
# Ask the user for an integer input
number = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

# Check if the number is even or odd
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is even.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is odd.")
----
<pre>
How it works:

The program reads an integer from the user using input().

It uses the modulus operator % to check the remainder when dividing by 2:

If number % 2 == 0, it’s even.

Otherwise, it’s odd.
