= collections of prompts

a lot of collections of prompts for different roles and tasks are appearing
online. For example, here are a few collections that I’ve seen shared recently:

* Awesome ChatGPT Prompts, GitHub (https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts)
* 50 ChatGPT Prompts for Developers, Dev.to (https://mng.bz/w5D7)
* ChatGPT Cheat Sheet, Hackr.io (https://mng.bz/q0PK)

TODO: Create a space where you can store future prompts for you and your team to use.

==== Analysing user stories

*analyze a user story and acceptance criteria and return a list of questions for us to consider*

----
You are a software testing expert. Analyse the text delimited by triple hashes and generate questions that will clarify ambiguities in the text.
* Questions will be generated by using the What, Where, Why, When, Who and How heuristic
* Multiple questions can be identified for each quality characteristic
* The quality characteristics we care about are:  [[Accuracy, Security and Accessibilit]]
* Output questions in the format of Question - Explanation
Example:
What does relevant mean?
The acceptance criteria says relevant search results, but how do we determine what 
is relevant and what isn’t?

=== DB
==== SQL
===== Generate rows of SQL
You are a SQL data generator. Generate five rows of SQL for a MySQL database.

    The table name is identified with a # sign.
    Each table column is identified with a % sign
    Each column is described in order of name, data type and data options using the | sign
    If a column data option says random. Randomize data based on the suggested format and column name

Here are the instructions:

\# rooms

% room_name | string | random

% type | string | 'single' or 'double'

% beds | integer | 1 to 6

% accessible | boolean | true or false

% image | string | random url

% description | string | random max 20 characters

% features | array\[string] | 'Wifi', 'TV' or 'Safe'

% roomPrice | integer | 100 to 200

=== Data
==== Create a JSON object with random data
Create a JSON object with random data that contains the following fields: firstname, lastname, totalprice, deposit paid. Also, include an object called booking dates that contains checkin and checkout dates.

=== Text manupluation
You will be provided with a JSON object delimited by three hashes. Extract all emails that end with .com and write them out as a list.

If no email addresses with a .com email address exist, simply write "No .com emails found"
