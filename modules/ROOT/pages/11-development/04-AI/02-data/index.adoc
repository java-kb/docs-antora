= Data


Data can  come from many different sources. Here is just a sampling:

• Web/social (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube)
• Biometric data (fitness trackers, genetics tests)
• Point of sale systems (from brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce sites)
• Internet of Things or IoT (ID tags and smart devices)
• Cloud systems (business applications like Salesforce.com)
• Corporate databases and spreadsheets

| **Hair Color** (Blonde, Brown, Black), **City** (New York, Paris, Tokyo),**Gender**: Male, Female,**Product type**: Electronics, Clothing, Food,**Customer status**: New, Returning

| *Numerical Data*
| Data that *is* a number and has mathematical meaning.
|

| Digging into data to figure out *why* something happened. Looks for reasons behind an outcome.
| **Why did it happen?**
| Analyzing customer data to find out **why** a particular product's sales dropped.
“Why did sales drop last week?”
“Why are customers leaving the app?”
➡️ Uses correlations, decision trees, and data mining to find causes.
| *Predictive Analytics*
| Using models (often AI/Machine Learning) to forecast what will happen next. Uses data to predict future outcomes.
| **What will happen?**
| Using a customer's history to predict **if they will cancel their service** next month.
“Will this customer cancel their subscription?”
“How many products will sell next month?”.
➡️ Uses AI and machine learning (regression, classification).
➡️ Models must be updated with new data to stay accurate.
| *Prescriptive Analytics*
| Leveraging predictions and rationales to advise on the best course of action. Goes beyond prediction and recommends actions.

== Types of Data
There are four ways to organize data. 

1.Structured data

which is  usually stored in a relational database or spreadsheet. Some examples include the following:
• Financial information
• Social Security numbers
• Addresses
• Product information
• Point of sale data
• Phone numbers

structured data is easier to work with. This data often 
comes from CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and ERP (Enterprise 
Resource Planning) systems—and usually has lower volumes.

There are various BI 
(Business Intelligence) programs that can help derive insights from structured 
data. However, this type of data accounts for about 20% of an AI project.


2.unstructured data

unstructured data is information that has no predefined formatting.

Here are examples of unstructured data:
• Images
• Videos
• Audio files
• Text files
• Social network information like tweets and posts
• Satellite images

3.semi-structured data

data that is a hybrid of structured and unstructured 
sources—called semi-structured data. The information has some internal tags 
that help with categorization.

Examples of semi-structured data include XML (Extensible Markup Language), 
which is based on various rules to identify elements of a document, and JSON 
(JavaScript Object Notation), which is a way to transfer information on the 
Web through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).

semi-structured data represents only about 5% to 10% of all data.

4.time-series data

which can be both for structured, unstructured, 
and semi-structured data. This type of information is for interactions, say for 
tracking the “customer journey.” This would be collecting information when a 
user goes to the web site, uses an app, or even walks into a store.

== Big Data
Big Data does have the following characteristics, which are called the three Vs: volume, variety, and velocity.

1.Volume

This is the scale of the data, which is often unstructured. There is no hard-
and-fast rule on a threshold, but it is usually tens of terabytes.
Volume is often a major challenge when it comes to Big Data. But cloud 
computing and next-generation databases have been a big help—in terms of 
capacity and lower costs.

2.Variety

This describes the diversity of the data, say a combination of structured, semi-
structured, and unstructured data. It also shows the 
different sources of the data and uses. No doubt, the high growth in 
unstructured data has been a key to the variety of Big Data.
Managing this can quickly become a major challenge. Yet machine learning is 
often something that can help streamline the process.

3.Velocity

This shows the speed at which data is being created. services like YouTube and Snapchat have extreme levels of velocity 
(this is often referred to as a “firehouse” of data). This requires heavy 
investments in next-generation technologies and data centers. The data is 
also often processed in memory not with disk-based systems.

Because of these issues, velocity is often considered the most difficult when 
it comes to the three Vs.

Other Vs 
added. Currently, there are over ten.
But here are some of the common ones:

• Veracity: This is about data that is deemed accurate.
• Value: This shows the usefulness of the data. Often this is about having a trusted source.
• Variability: This means that data will usually change over time. For example, this is the case with social media content that can morph based on overall sentiment regarding new developments and breaking news.
• Visualization: This is using visuals—like graphs—to better understand the data.

== Data Process
The CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a widely-used, iterative methodology for data science projects, outlining six key phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. It provides a structured yet flexible framework, allowing movement back and forth between phases to ensure projects align with business goals, from defining the problem to implementing the final solution and planning for maintenance

The Six Phases of CRISP-DM:

1.*Business Understanding:*

Define project objectives, assess the situation (resources, risks, benefits), set data mining goals, and   create a project plan.

You should come up with a clear view of the business problem to be solved. 
Some examples:
• How might a price adjustment impact your sales?
• Will a change in copy lead to improved conversion of 
digital ads?
• Does a fall in engagement mean there will be an increase 
in churn?
Then, you must establish how you will measure success. Might it be tha

In step #1, you should also assemble the right team for the project. you may only need a couple people with a background in data science.

Finally, you will need to evaluate the technical needs. What infrastructure and 
software tools will be used? Will there be a need to increase capacity or 
purchase new solutions?

2.*Data Understanding:* 

Collect initial data, explore it, describe its quality, and identify potential issues.

In this step, you will look at the data sources for the project. Consider that 
there are three main ones, which include the following:

• In-House Data: This data may come from a web site, 
beacons in a store location, IoT sensors, mobile apps, and 
so on. A major advantage of this data is that it is free and 
customized to your business. But then again, there are 
some risks. There can be problems if there has not been 
enough attention on the data formatting or what data 
should be selected.
• Open Source Data: This is usually freely available, which is 
certainly a nice benefit. Some examples of open source 
data include government and scientific information. The 
data is often accessed through an API, which makes the 
process fairly straightforward. Open source data is also 
usually well formatted. However, some of the variables 
may not be clear, and there could be bias, such as being 
skewed to a certain demographic.
• Third-Party Data: This is data from a commercial vendor. 
But the fees can be high. In fact, the data quality, in some 
cases, may be lacking.

But despite the source, all data must be trusted. If not, there will likely be the problem of “garbage in, garbage out.”

To evaluate the data, you need to answer questions like the following:

• Is the data complete? What might be missing?
• Where did the data come from?
• What were the collection points?
• Who touched the data and processed it?
• What have been the changes in the data?
• What are the quality issues?

If you are working with structured data, then this stage should be easier. 
However, when it comes to unstructured and semi-structured data, you will 
need to label the data—which can be a protracted process. 

3.*Data Preparation:* 

This often time-consuming phase involves selecting, cleaning, constructing, integrating, and formatting data for modeling.

The first step in the data preparation process is to decide what datasets 
to use.

Let’s take a look at a scenario: Suppose you work for a publishing company 
and want to put together a strategy to improve customer retention. Some 
of the data that should help would include demographic information on 
the customer base like age, sex, income, and education. To provide more 
color, you can also look at browser information. What type of content 
interests customers? What’s the frequency and duration? Any other 
interesting patterns—say accessing information during weekends? By 
combining the sources of information, you can put together a powerful 
model. For example, if there is a drop-off in activity in certain areas, it 
could pose a risk of cancellation. This would alert sales people to reach 
out to the customers.

Next, when in the data preparation stage, there will need to be data cleansing. 
some actions you can take to cleanse the data:

• De-duplication: Set tests to identify any duplications and 
delete the extraneous data.
• Outliers: This is data that is well beyond the range of most 
of the rest of the data. This may indicate that the 
information  is not helpful. But of course, there are 
situations where the reverse is true. This would be for 
fraud deduction.
• Consistency: Make sure you have clear definitions for the 
variables. Even terms like “revenue” or “customer” can 
have multiple meanings.
• Validation Rules: As you look at the data, try to find the 
inherent limitations. For example, you can have a flag for 
the age column. If it is over 120 in many cases, then the 
data has some serious issues.
• Binning: Certain data may not need to be specific. Does it 
really matter if someone is 35 or 37? Probably not. But 
comparing those from 30–40 to 41–50 probably would.
• Staleness: Is the data timely and relevant?
• Merging: In some cases, the columns of data may have 
very similar information. Perhaps one has height in inches 
and another in feet. If your model does not require a 
more detailed number, you can just use the one for feet.
• One-Hot Encoding: This is a way to replace categorical 
data as numbers. Example: Let’s say we have a database 
with a column that has three possible values: Apple, 
Pineapple, and Orange. You could represent Apple as 1, 
Pineapple as 2, and Orange as 3. Sounds reasonable, 
right? Perhaps not. The problem is that an AI algorithm 
may think that Orange is greater than Apple. But with 
one-hot encoding, you can avoid this problem. You will 
create three new columns: is_Apple, is_Pineapple, and 
is_Orange. For each row in the data, you’ll put 1 for 
where the fruit exists and 0 for the rest.
• Conversion Tables: You can use this when translating data 
from one standard to another. This would be the case if 
you have data in the decimal system and want to move 
over to the metric system.

There are also automation tools that can help out, such as from companies like SAS, 
Oracle, IBM, Lavastorm Analytics, and Talend. Then there are open source 
projects, such as OpenRefine, plyr, and reshape2.

Data cleansing approaches will also depend on the use cases for the AI project. 
For example, if you are building a system for predictive maintenance in 
manufacturing, the challenge will be to handle the wide variations from 
different sensors. The result is that a large amount of the data may have little 
value and be mostly noise.

4.*Modeling*: 

Select modeling techniques, generate test designs, build the models, and assess them.

5.*Evaluation:*
Evaluate model results against business objectives, review the entire process, and decide on next steps.

6.*Deployment:* 
Plan for the model's operational use, including monitoring, maintenance, final reporting, and project review

== Quantity of data(How Much Data Do You Need for AI?)
the relationship between the amount of data, the complexity of the problem, and the performance of the model.

People often say: “The more data, the better.” This is usually true, but only up to a point.

1️⃣ More features can help — at first (Hughes Phenomenon)

In machine learning, features are the pieces of information we give the model.

Example:
If you’re predicting house prices:

1 feature → size of the house

3 features → size, location, number of rooms

10 features → size, location, rooms, age, nearby schools, transport, etc.

As you add useful features, the model often becomes more accurate.
This idea is called the Hughes Phenomenon:

Adding features can improve performance.

2️⃣ But more is not always better (Data can start to hurt)

After a while, adding more features can cause problems instead of solving them.

Why?

Some features are noisy or irrelevant

The model becomes harder to train

You need much more data to support all those features

This leads to a famous problem in AI.

3️⃣ The Curse of Dimensionality (the real danger)

Each feature adds a dimension to the data.
As dimensions increase, the data space becomes huge.

Charles Isbell explains it simply:

When the number of features grows, the amount of data needed grows exponentially.

Simple analogy:

Imagine:

1 dimension → a straight line

2 dimensions → a square

3 dimensions → a cube

Each new dimension multiplies the space.
To “cover” that space properly, you need far more data points.

4️⃣ Practical impact: You may never have enough data

This is the key takeaway:

At some point, you might not be able to collect enough data to train a good model.

Example: Image recognition

Even a small RGB image might be:

50 × 50 pixels

Each pixel has 3 values (Red, Green, Blue)

That’s:

50 × 50 × 3 = 7,500 dimensions

Now imagine:

High-resolution images

Real-time HD video (many images per second)

The number of dimensions becomes enormous, and the data needed to train a reliable model becomes extremely large.

This is why:

Vision recognition is hard

Video analysis is even harder

Poor data quality or too many features can break the model

5️⃣ The bottom line (in one sentence)

✔ More data and more features can improve AI models—but only if you have enough high-quality data to support them. Otherwise, complexity works against you.

💡 The Data Dilemma in AI: More is Better, Until It's Not
1. The "More is Better" Rule (Hughes Phenomenon)

The general starting point in AI is that more data usually leads to a better-performing model.

    The Idea: The more examples (data) you give your model, the better it learns the underlying patterns and can make accurate predictions.

    Hughes Phenomenon: This observation specifically states that as you add more characteristics (called features or dimensions) to describe your data, the model's performance tends to improve.

        Example: If you're building a model to predict house prices, adding features like "square footage," "number of bedrooms," and "zip code" (more data/features) generally makes the prediction more accurate.

2. The Catch: The "Curse of Dimensionality"

While adding features can improve performance, it eventually makes the data demands skyrocket. This problem is known as the Curse of Dimensionality.

    The Problem: According to experts like Charles Isbell, as you increase the number of features (or dimensions) that describe your data, the amount of data you need to train a reliable model grows exponentially (much, much faster).

    Simplified Analogy:

        Imagine trying to scatter 10 pieces of data evenly along a 1D line (1 feature). It's easy.

        Now try to scatter those 10 pieces evenly across a 2D square (2 features). They become very sparse (far apart).

        Now try to scatter them evenly in a 3D cube (3 features). They are now extremely isolated.

        In high-dimensional space (many features), your 10 pieces of data effectively become tiny, isolated points, and the space between them is empty. The model cannot "see" patterns because the data is too spread out.

3. The Practical Impact (Why It Matters)

The Curse of Dimensionality is a major hurdle in complex applications:

    Problem: If the number of features is too high, the amount of data required to fill that high-dimensional space becomes so enormous that it's practically impossible to gather enough.

    Result: You cannot create a reliable model because your available data is too sparse to generalize accurately.

    Real-World Example (Vision Recognition):

        A simple RGB image (like one from your phone) has roughly 7,500 dimensions (features) because you have hundreds of pixels, and each pixel has Red, Green, and Blue values.

        Imagine working with real-time, high-definition video. The number of features increases dramatically per second (thousands of pixels times three colors times 30 or 60 frames per second). The data needed to train a model for this becomes astronomical, making it a very intensive and difficult process.

In summary, AI requires a balance: You need enough data to cover the complexity of the features, but if the features get too complex, you may hit a point where the required data volume exceeds what is possible to collect.
