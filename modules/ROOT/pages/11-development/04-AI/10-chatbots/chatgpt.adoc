= ChatGPT development
:figures: 11-development/04-AI

ChatGPT is a prompt-based Generative AI that engages the user in a dialogue 
that helps them explore ideas to aid in the design and development of entire projects. In addition, ChatGPT artfully generates documentation for each method it 
writes.

ChatGPT (as of this writing) does not support development within an IDE. However, unlike GitHub Copilot and AWS CodeWhisperer, it can produce entire 
projects and easily translate code from one programming language to another. 
Copilot and CodeWhisperer take hints from your comments to infer what code 
you want to write. With ChatGPT, you explicitly write prompts that ChatGPT uses 
to create the code.

We should always double-check ChatGPT’s work and 
never assume that it is 100% safe or accurate. You will occasionally find that ChatGPT 
produces code that doesn’t work—ChatGPT is focused on generating the next token 
rather than thinking of systems as we do.

== Custom Instructions
With custom instructions in ChatGPT, you can tweak how the responses come out to
suit what you need. This feature lets you save time because you don’t have to keep
fine-tuning responses or coming up with new prompts every time you chat with the
bot. You can switch on custom instructions in your profile.
When you set up a custom instruction, you’ll need to answer these two questions:

 ChatGPT: What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better
responses?

 ChatGPT: How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

Let’s take an example:

 ChatGPT: What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better respon‐
ses?

 Developer: I am a programmer working with a team that follows the PEP 8 style guide
for Python code. We value clean, readable code and adhere to best practices. I usually
work on data processing and analysis tasks, and I often need help with writing efficient
and well-structured code.

 ChatGPT: How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

 Developer: I would like ChatGPT to provide Python code snippets that adhere to the
PEP 8 style guide. It should prioritize readability and best practices in coding. When
suggesting solutions, I prefer explanations as to why a particular approach is recom‐
mended and how it aligns with PEP 8 standards. I would also appreciate it if ChatGPT
could point out any common pitfalls or errors related to the task at hand and provide
tips for avoiding them.

== Browse with Bing
ChatGPT’s training has a cutoff of April 2023. This can be a problem for developers.
With libraries, frameworks, and tools changing so fast, any number of new features or
capabilities may have popped up since then, and ChatGPT won’t be up-to-date on
them.

But ChatGPT’s got a trick up its sleeve: Browsing with Bing. It lets you do real-time
web searches to come up with answers.

Let’s say you’re checking out a new framework, like LangChain. It’s been on the scene
since late 2022, and it has evolved a lot. It’s also designed to make app development
with LLMs smoother, so you might like to use it.

To activate Browse with Bing and enhance ChatGPT’s understanding of where Lang‐
Chain is at right now, add something like “Use the internet for this response” to your

 prompt. Here are some examples of prompts designed to get general information
about LangChain:

 Prompt: Tell me about the LangChain framework and its primary features. Use the
internet for the response.

 Prompt: Check the internet for introductory resources or documentation for getting
started with LangChain.

 Prompt: Browse the internet for examples of applications that have been built using the
LangChain framework.

 Prompt: Look up any recent updates or releases related to the LangChain framework.
Use the internet for the response.

You can instruct ChatGPT to focus on certain types of sources. Following table provides some suggestions.

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Approach |Description

|Domain restriction
|Use the site operator to limit the search to reputable domains like .edu or .gov or to specific reputable organizations.

|Use of scholarly keywords
|Examples include peer-reviewed, journal, study, and research.

|Use of publication date filters
|Filter the search by recent publication dates to get current and relevant information.

|Professional or scholarly associations
|Specify professional or scholarly associations to seek authoritative publications or reports.

== Regular Expressions

ChatGPT can create a regex. Here’s a look at some common examples:

 Prompt: Create a regex pattern to validate standard email addresses. The email should
start with alphanumeric characters, followed by optional dots, hyphens, or under‐
scores. Then, there should be an “@” symbol, followed by more alphanumeric charac‐
ters, a dot, and finally, a domain name that is 2 to 6 characters long.
Regex pattern: ^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$

 Prompt: Provide me with a regex pattern to validate URLs. The URL may start with
“http” or “https”, followed by “://”, then a domain name which can include alphanu‐
meric characters and dots. After the domain, there can be an optional path that starts
with a “/” and can include alphanumeric characters, slashes, dots, or hyphens. The
URL may end with an optional “/”.
Regex pattern: ^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z.-]+)\.([a-z.]{2,6})([\/\w .-]*)*\/?$

 Prompt: Create a regex pattern to validate dates in the MM/DD/YYYY format. The
month should be between 01 and 12, the day should be between 01 and 31, and the
year should be either in the 1900s or 2000s.
Regex pattern: ^(0[1-9]|1[0-2])\/(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])\/(19|20)\d\d$

 Prompt: I’m looking for a regex pattern to validate IPv4 addresses. Each octet should be
a number between 0 and 255, and the octets should be separated by dots. Create a
regex pattern for this.
Regex pattern: ^(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d\d?)\.((25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d\d?)\.){2}
(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[0-1]?\d\d?)$

ChatGPT can also help you decipher regex patterns. Here’s a sample prompt:

 Prompt: What is this regex? ^(\(\d{3}\)\s?|\d{3}[-.])\d{3}[-.]\d{4}$

== Starter Code
Starter code is the initial code snippets or templates that give you a head start. 

Following table shows some prompts for starter code.

|===
|Programming language/framework |Prompt

|Node.js/Express.js |Provide an example of a basic Express.js server.
|React (JavaScript) |How do I create a simple React component?
|JavaScript |Can you show me how to define a simple function in JavaScript?
|Android (Java) |What is the starter code for a basic Android Activity in Java?

== GitHub README
Imagine you’ve just built this awesome app for digging up recipes. Here’s a prompt to kick things off:

    Prompt: Write a GitHub readme for my project named “Recipe Finder.” This project is
    developed using Vue.js and helps users find recipes based on the ingredients they have.
    Users need to input the ingredients they have, and the app will return a list of recipes
    they can cook with those ingredients. To kickstart, simply clone the repository, run
    npm install, insert your API key into the .env file, and execute npm start to launch
    the app.

== Cross-Browser Compatibility
Cross-browser compatibility is about making sure your website or web app works right
on different browsers. It’s important because your users likely access your site or app
using a whole mix of browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, all of which
have various versions.
