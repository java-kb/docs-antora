=  GitHub Copilot

Much like other LLMs, Copilot is triggered by prompts. But unlike a chat-based 
LLM (such as ChatGPT), Copilot is tuned to process code-based rather than text-based 
prompts. This distinction is important because it highlights both the benefits of differ-
ent types of fine-tuned LLMs for different activities, as well as the need to write prompts 
that work for different prompt types.
