= AI-Assisted Programming
:figures: 11-development/04-AI/dev

TODO: Add thhis prompts to modules/ROOT/pages/11-development/04-AI/prompt-engineering/prompts.adoc

AI-assisted programming tools are crafted to enhance developers’ abilities, enabling
them to zero in on advanced problem solving and innovations instead of being
ensnared in monotonous tasks or complex code details. This is why GitHub’s use of
the word copilot is spot on. It’s about having that reliable buddy in the cockpit, navi‐
gating through the intricate and often tedious aspects of coding, allowing you to focus
on what matters.

Let’s look at a simple example. For this, we’ll use ChatGPT, which has a robust ability
to gin up code. We will use a prompt to ask what we want the system to do. Suppose we give it the following prompt:

 Prompt: In Python, write a program that checks if a given integer is even or odd and print the result.

[source,python,attributes]
----
# Ask the user for an integer input
number = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

# Check if the number is even or odd
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is even.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is odd.")
----
<pre>
How it works:

The program reads an integer from the user using input().

It uses the modulus operator % to check the remainder when dividing by 2:

If number % 2 == 0, it’s even.

Otherwise, it’s odd.
</pre>

== Evaluation of AI-Assisted Programming Tools
* You’ve got to weigh many factors like its precision, chat features, security, speed, and user-friendliness.
* get recommendations from other developers. 
* Plus, it’s a good idea to test drive a few yourself. Luckily, most of these tools offer free trials, so you can give them a whirl without committing right off the bat.
* Another key aspect to consider is the company’s financial backing. Does it have venture capital funding? Without this, a company might struggle not just to grow but also to keep its platform innovative. 

== Learning
You can use ChatGPT to 
* get the lowdown on all the basics and syntax of the code.
* Plus, if you’re more of a learn-by-doing type, you can ask for code examples to see
how everything clicks together. 
* If you already know one programming language,
ChatGPT can make learning a new one easier by comparing the two. Suppose you’re
good with Python but just diving into JavaScript; it can explain the main differences
in Python terms. 
* If you need more resources, ChatGPT can scour the internet and
recommend some solid learning materials for you.
* you can use ChatGPT to get help with LeetCode
+
Prompt: Suggest 3 common LeetCode interview questions.

Prompt Examples:

Prompt: For someone who does not know Python, what should I learn first?

Prompt: What are some beginner-friendly projects I can try to improve my skills in React?

Prompt: Can you suggest resources for learning advanced SQL queries?

Prompt: How would you implement a basic “to-do list” app in both Python and Java‐Script to highlight their differences?

Prompt: I know how to use loops in C++. Can you show me how loops work in Python for comparison?

Prompt: Find 5 useful YouTube videos that show how to learn Rust.

You can have ChatGPT create useful study guides as well. Here’s a sample prompt:

Prompt: Create a study guide for JavaScript. Focus on a beginner level.

Prompt: Please create a study schedule for me. What topics should I study? What about practice exercises or quizzes? Coding problems? Links to resources?


== Software Development
=== Brainstorming
with an LLM like ChatGPT, you can do some brainstorming.

First of all, you can have it provide different approaches. Here’s a prompt:

 Prompt: What are techniques for brainstorming ideas for new products? Use the internet to research this question.

Suppose you want to use the starbursting approach. You can learn more about this with the following prompt:

 Prompt: How would you use starbursting as a way to come up with a new idea for a software product?

If you want to come up with a list of ideas. It’s best to zero in on a specific
category, know who you’re targeting, and understand what problem you want to
tackle. Here are a few prompts to get you started:

 Prompt: I want to develop a health-tracking app for seniors. The problem is the diffi‐
culty they face in monitoring chronic conditions and medication schedules. What fea‐
tures can be included to make the app senior-friendly and assist in managing their
health more effectively?

 Prompt: The target audience is college students struggling with managing their finan‐
ces. What features should a budgeting app include to help them track expenses, save
money, and understand financial planning easily?

 Prompt: I want to create a language learning app for busy professionals who struggle to
find time for regular classes. Can you suggest features that cater to their tight schedules
and offer quick, effective language-learning sessions?

=== Market Research
Before diving into a software project, it’s smart to ask a few key questions: 
* Is there actually a need for this tool? 
* Are customers willing to shell out cash for it? 
* And just how big is the market for it?

First of all, we need to figure out the target audience. Think about who’s going to get the most out of this
software. Let’s start brainstorming about who these users might be. Consider this
prompt:
 
 Prompt: What are potential target demographics for a project management software program?

You can then have ChatGPT take on a task that’s important for getting to know your
marketing: creating detailed user personas. Think of these personas as characters that
give you snapshots of the different kinds of people who might use your product.
Details often include how old they are, their interests, their jobs, and their lifestyles.
By mapping out these personas, you start to understand who your customers are and
what they’re looking for.

ChatGPT can also be instrumental in drafting surveys and questionnaires to gather
specific data.
 
 Prompt: Could you create a survey focused on understanding what buyers look for in
project management software? The survey should include questions that help identify
key features, usability preferences, specific industry needs, and any particular chal‐
lenges buyers want to address with this type of software. Additionally, please include
questions that gauge the importance of factors such as cost, support, scalability, and
integration capabilities.

==== Market Trends
 Prompt: Research the internet to find current trends in <specific software category, e.g.,
mobile gaming, educational technology> as of <year>.

 Prompt: Research the internet to provide an overview of emerging technologies in the
software industry that are gaining popularity in <year>.

 Prompt: Research the internet to find the consumer behavior trends that are currently
influencing the software market, particularly in <target demographic or application
type>.

 Prompt: Research the internet to find the latest trends in user interface and user experi‐
ence (UI/UX) design for software applications in <year>.

 Prompt: Research the internet to come up with a list of the top software applications in
<a specific field or category> and explain what makes them successful in the current
market.
==== Total Addressable Market
The total addressable market, or TAM for short, is an estimate of the maximum
amount of money you could make if everyone who could use your product actually
did. This helps you figure out where to focus your energy, how to position your prod‐
uct in the market, and what your growth game plan should be. It’s a reality check that
helps you set achievable goals for how much of the market you can grab and the cash
you can bring in.

 prompt: What are the different ways to estimate the size of the TAM?”

Suppose you have a startup in the medical technology category:

    Prompt: SilverConnect Health is a health tech startup focusing on telemedicine serv‐
    ices. The target market is in the United States, with a focus on elderly populations in
    urban areas. What is the current size of the telemedicine services market for Silver‐
    Connect Health? What are the projected growth rates for this market segment over the
    next 5–10 years?

=== Competition
There are several key benefits of competitive analysis. 
* First of all, it gives you a sneak
peek into the market. You get to see what’s already out there, what’s working, and
what’s not. This helps you spot any gaps that your software can fill, making sure you
bring something fresh to the table.
* Then, there’s learning from your competitors—both from their wins and their oops
moments. This can really up your game.
* Also, when you know what makes your software different, you can get specific with
your marketing, hitting the right people more effectively.
As for ChatGPT, it can be helpful with competitive analysis. Here are some prompts:

    Prompt: List the main competitors for <your software type> in the <specific industry or
    market>.

    Prompt: Compare the features of <your software> with its top three competitors.

    Prompt: What are the pricing models used by competitors of <your software> in the
    market?

    Prompt: How do the leading competitors position themselves in the market for <type of
    software>?

    Prompt: Identify the strengths and weaknesses of <competitor’s name> software.

    Prompt: Summarize the customer reviews for <competitor’s software name> focusing on
    user satisfaction and pain points.

You can also have ChatGPT put the analysis in a table, which can make it clearer:

    Prompt: Can you provide a summary in bullet points of the key players in the customer
    relationship management (CRM) software market as of 2023? Put the results in a table.

ChatGPT can even do a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats)
analysis. This helps you play up your strong points, fix or work around weak spots,
grab chances that come by, and dodge any curveballs. 

=== Requirements
==== benefits:
* Give you direction:
These documents lay out exactly what the software should do. Everyone, from
developers to clients, gets what the plan is, which keeps things on track.
* Keep everyone on the same page:
They make sure everyone involved, like your team and your clients, understands
what’s expected. This way, there’s less chance of mix-ups or wrong turns.
* Help with planning:
Need to figure out how long things will take or how much they’ll cost? These
documents are your go-to for planning out the work, time, and money needed.
* Improve communication:
They’re great for clear communication, especially in big teams or when people
are geographically spread out.
* Reduce risks:
Spotting potential problems early on? That’s what these documents help you do,
so you can dodge delays and keep costs under control.

In the world of software development, there’s an array of different requirements, each
serving a unique purpose. You’ve got functional requirements that lay out what the
software should do, like the tasks it should perform or the features it needs. Then
there are non-functional requirements, which are about how the software should
operate, such as with performance speed, security, and usability.

There’s an art to writing effective PRDs and SRSs. It’s important to strike the right
tone. These documents should be clear, concise, and professional.
Let’s break down why the writing style matters:

* Making it crystal clear:
These documents are like the holy grail for your project. You want everything to
be spot-on so that everyone gets what’s going on. This way, you dodge those
pesky miscommunications and development blunders.
* Sticking to the facts:
PRDs and SRSs aren’t the place for personal or stylistic flair. You need to be like a
news reporter here—just the facts, please. Keeping it straightforward and neutral
ensures that you’re focusing on what the product really needs.
* Consistency is key:
You want to keep the same tone from start to finish. Think of it as following a
recipe. If you start switching things up halfway, you’re going to end up with a
mess. Consistency makes these often hefty documents easier to digest.
* Keeping the focus on the product:
Remember, the star of the show here is the product and what it’s supposed to do.
Keeping a direct tone ensures you don’t stray from the main plot—that is, the
functionality and requirements.

When it comes to an LLM like ChatGPT, writing is one of its strengths. It can really
up your game. And yes, you can instruct the LLM to hit the right tone, as with this
prompt:

    Prompt: Please draft a comprehensive list of technical requirements for a mobile banking app, ensuring the writing is clear, well structured, and professional.

==== Product Requirements Document(PRD)
A PRD sets forth what your software will be and do. Think of it as a story, outlining
what the application should look like, how it should behave, who’s going to use it, and
what problems it’s going to solve. It is often detailed, covering everything from the
must-have features to the user experience.

The audience for the PRD is diverse. It is for developers, designers, project managers,
and the quality assurance team. It’s also crucial for executives or other stakeholders
who need to understand the product’s vision and goals. Moreover, it can be useful for
marketing teams to get an understanding of how to position the product. Essentially,
it’s for anyone involved in bringing the product to market and making sure it hits the
mark with its intended users.

If you haven’t seen a PRD, ChatGPT can help out:
    
    Prompt: What are the main parts of a PRD? Create a Word document as a template.

==== Software Requirements Specification(SRS)
How is the SRS different from the PRD? The SRS is like the nitty-gritty technical
manual for a software project. Unlike the PRD, which takes on the perspective of end
users or customers and focuses on what they need and why, the SRS goes deep into
the specifics of what the software needs to do and how it should do it, focusing on the
technical aspects.

If you have a simple app, the SRS could be just a few pages. But with more complex
projects—say for an enterprise software implementation—it can easily run hundreds
of pages.

Let’s take a look at some prompts:

    Prompt: What are the essential elements and best practices to consider when drafting
    an effective SRS?
    
    Prompt: Outline the process for developing an SRS, emphasizing the steps involved in
    gathering and analyzing requirements, stakeholder collaboration, and documentation
    methodologies.
    
    Prompt: Create a detailed SRS for a software project, including sections like Project
    Overview, Stakeholder Analysis, Functional and Non-functional Requirements,
    Assumptions, and Constraints. <Add the details you want for each.>

==== Interviews
voice recognition software can improve interviews:

* Accuracy and playback:
While transcription accuracy is usually pretty good, you can use playback for
corrections.:
* Speaker identification
Voice recognition can differentiate speakers in a meeting. This can help bring
clarity to the requirements.:
* Key topics identification
Voice recognition software can highlight frequent keywords in the transcript,
making it easier to identify and focus on main topics or requirements.
Summaries of key points:
* Voice recognition software can produce summaries of key points and suggest
action items, aiding developers in pinpointing critical requirements and converting them into specific project tasks.

Some of the top voice recognition software systems include:

• Otter AI
• Fathom
• Rev
• Sonix
• Notta

==== Whiteboarding
Whiteboarding is a common practice when putting together requirements for soft‐
ware projects. It can help with the brainstorming process and allow everyone to chip
in. It allows for collecting lots of different ideas and viewpoints, which is key for nail‐
ing down what the software should do. It’s also hands-on—you can sketch out flow‐
charts or diagrams during the discussion, making complex stuff easier to get.

ChatGPT can help with this It can decipher images that you upload to the system. You can upload a handwriting image then ask it to analyze it

===  Project Planning

Project Planning involves setting clear goals and figuring out
what you need to do, who’s doing what, when it’s happening, and how. The main
objective is to keep things running smoothly, make sure everyone’s productive, and,
in the end, have a product that does what it’s supposed to do and makes everyone,
especially the customers, happy.

Some common project-planning approaches are waterfall, Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and
Extreme Programming (XP). Picking the right one is important because it can make
or break your project. Your choice depends on many factors like how big and com‐
plex your project is, what your client needs, how your team works together, and how
certain or uncertain things are in your project world. Some teams might stick to one
method, but others might mix and match to find the perfect fit for their project.

To know more about this appraoches, Here’s a look at some other prompts you might use:

    Prompt: How can teams effectively select and tailor a project-planning approach to fit
their specific software project?

    Prompt: Discuss the importance of aligning a project-planning approach with the goals
and complexity of a software project.

    Prompt: Explain the sequential phases of the waterfall model in software project man‐
agement.

    Prompt: Describe the core principles of Agile methodology in software development.

    Prompt: How does Agile methodology facilitate flexibility and customer involvement
in a project?

    Prompt: Outline the roles and ceremonies involved in the Scrum framework.

    Prompt: Compare and contrast Scrum and traditional project management
approaches.

    Prompt: List the key practices of Extreme Programming and how they contribute to
customer satisfaction.

    Prompt: Discuss the benefits and challenges of implementing test-driven development
as part of XP.

As for prompts, let’s take an example. Suppose you are building a “to-do list” app. You
have created a one-page requirements document for it, and now you ask ChatGPT:

    Prompt:Please draft a comprehensive list of technical requirements for a to-do list app, ensuring the writing is clear, well structured, and professional.
    
    Prompt: What is the best project planning approach for this app?

Here’s an example of a prompt for TDD, using GWT:

    Prompt: Formulate a testing approach for critical features using the Given-When-Then
    methodology. The specific requirements include:
    • Develop an online booking system for a chain of boutique hotels.
    • The system must pull room availability data from each hotel’s internal manage‐
    ment software.
    • It should allow users to filter rooms by date, price, and amenities.
    • The interface needs to be intuitive and compatible with both desktop and mobile
    browsers.
    • The system should be built using cloud-based solutions to ensure reliability and
    scalability.

ChatGPT::
Below is a testing approach using the Given-When-Then (GWT) methodology, structured around the critical features of your online boutique-hotel booking system.

*Given-When-Then Testing Approach for Critical Features*

*1. Room Availability Integration (Data Pull From Internal Systems)*

*Scenario 1: Successful Room Availability Retrieval*

Given the hotel’s internal management system is online
And valid API credentials are configured
When the booking system requests room availability for a selected date range
Then the system should receive accurate and up-to-date availability data
And store it temporarily for rendering in the UI.

*Scenario 2: Internal System Timeout or Failure*

Given the hotel’s internal management system is unresponsive or slow
When the booking system attempts to fetch availability
Then the system should retry a configurable number of times
And present a friendly error message to the user
And log the incident for operational monitoring.

*Scenario 3: Partial Data Retrieval*

Given some hotels respond with availability but others do not
When the system aggregates availability results
Then it should display results from available hotels
And indicate which hotels could not be queried.

*2. Filtering Rooms by Date, Price, and Amenities*

*Scenario 4: Filter by Date Range*

Given rooms are available across multiple dates
When the user selects a check-in and check-out date
Then the system should only show rooms available during the selected period.

*Scenario 5: Filter by Price*

Given a list of rooms with different nightly rates
When the user sets a price range filter
Then only rooms whose total cost falls within the selected price range should appear.

*Scenario 6: Filter by Amenities*

Given rooms include amenities such as Wi-Fi, pool access, breakfast, and balcony
When the user selects one or more amenity filters
Then only rooms matching all selected amenities should appear.

*Scenario 7: Combined Filters*

Given date, price, and amenity filters are applied together
When the user updates any of the filters
Then the system should display results that match all active criteria
And update the results in real time without page reloads.

*3. Intuitive & Responsive User Interface*

*Scenario 8: Desktop Responsiveness*

Given the user loads the system on a desktop browser
When the user navigates through room listings and filter panels
Then the layout should remain clean, intuitive, and fully functional
And UI elements should resize appropriately.

*Scenario 9: Mobile Responsiveness*

Given the user accesses the booking system on a mobile browser
When the user applies filters or views room details
Then the interface should adapt to smaller screens
And actions should be accessible with minimal scrolling
And touch targets must be usable.

*Scenario 10: Cross-Browser Compatibility*

Given users may browse using Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
When the system loads and interacts with user input
Then features should behave consistently across supported browsers.

*4. Booking Workflow Reliability*

*Scenario 11: User Proceeds to Booking*

Given a user has selected an available room
When they click “Book Now”
Then the system should validate availability in real time
And lock the room temporarily
And allow the user to proceed to the payment steps.

*Scenario 12: Room Unavailable at Checkout*

Given availability has changed since initial search
When the user attempts to finalize booking
Then the system should notify them of the change
And provide alternative room suggestions.

*5. Cloud-Based Reliability and Scalability*

*Scenario 13: High Traffic Load*

Given the system is deployed on cloud infrastructure
When there is a sudden spike in concurrent users
Then the system should autoscale to maintain performance
And response times should remain within acceptable limits.

*Scenario 14: Cloud Service Outage*

Given a cloud region or service experiences downtime
When failover mechanisms activate
Then the system should switch to a secondary region or service
And continue operating with minimal disruption.

*Scenario 15: Data Consistency Across Distributed Systems*

Given the system runs across multiple nodes or regions
When availability or booking data is updated
Then the update should propagate consistently
And users should not see outdated or conflicting information.

*6. Security and Data Integrity*

Scenario 16: Secure Data Transmission

Given the user submits personal or payment data
When the system sends the information to backend services
Then all communication should be encrypted (HTTPS/TLS).

*Scenario 17: Rate Limiting for API Calls*

Given the internal hotel systems have usage limits
When the booking system polls for availability
Then it should respect API rate limits
And queue or batch requests when necessary.

Gemini::

*Testing Approach: Boutique Hotel Booking System (Given-When-Then)*

This testing approach utilizes *Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)*. By using the *Given-When-Then* syntax, we bridge the gap between the technical requirements (cloud integration, APIs) and the business requirements (user experience, booking flow).

Below is the breakdown of test scenarios for the critical features outlined.

'''

*1. Feature: Real-Time Inventory Integration*

*Requirement:* The system must pull room availability data from each hotel’s internal management software. +
*Criticality:* High. Prevents double bookings and ensures data accuracy.

image::data-flow-diagram.png

*Scenario A: Successful Data Synchronization*
* *Given* the "Hotel Grand" internal management system lists "Room 101" as *Available* for the dates Dec 1st–Dec 3rd
* *And* the cloud connector service is active
* *When* a user searches for availability at "Hotel Grand" for Dec 1st–Dec 3rd
* *Then* the online booking system should display "Room 101" as bookable
* *And* the price displayed matches the internal system's dynamic rate.

*Scenario B: Handling Race Conditions (Double Booking Prevention)*
* *Given* only *1* Deluxe Suite remains at "Hotel Azure"
* *And* User A is on the payment screen for this suite
* *When* User B attempts to select the same Deluxe Suite for the same dates
* *Then* the system should display a "Room no longer available" error to User B
* *And* trigger a refresh of User B’s search results to show current inventory.

'''

*2. Feature: Advanced Search & Filtering*

*Requirement:* Allow users to filter rooms by date, price, and amenities. +
*Criticality:* Medium-High. Directly impacts conversion rates and user satisfaction.

*Scenario A: Multi-Criteria Filtering*
* *Given* the user is viewing a list of 50 available rooms
* *And* the list contains rooms ranging from $100 to $500 per night
* *When* the user applies a price filter for *"$100 - $200"*
* *And* selects the amenity checkbox for *"Ocean View"*
* *Then* the results should only show rooms within the $100-$200 range that possess the "Ocean View" tag
* *And* the total count of results should update instantly.

*Scenario B: No Results Handling*
* *Given* the user is on the search page
* *When* the user selects a date range where the hotel is fully booked
* *Then* the system should display a polite "No rooms available" message
* *And* suggest alternative dates or nearby boutique hotels in the chain.

'''

*3. Feature: Responsive UI (Desktop & Mobile)*

*Requirement:* Interface must be intuitive and compatible with both desktop and mobile browsers. +
*Criticality:* High. Users frequently book travel on mobile devices.

*Scenario A: Mobile Layout Adaptation*
* *Given* the user is accessing the booking URL via a mobile browser (e.g., Chrome on iOS)
* *When* the landing page loads
* *Then* the navigation menu should collapse into a "Hamburger" menu
* *And* the "Book Now" button should span the full width of the screen for touch accessibility
* *And* no horizontal scrolling should be required to view room details.

*Scenario B: Desktop Precision*
* *Given* the user is accessing the site via a desktop browser at 1920x1080 resolution
* *When* the user hovers over a room thumbnail
* *Then* a high-resolution preview or tooltip should appear
* *And* the multi-column layout should utilize the screen width effectively without overlapping elements.

'''

*4. Feature: Cloud Reliability & Scalability*

*Requirement:* Built using cloud-based solutions to ensure reliability and scalability. +
*Criticality:* Critical. The system must handle traffic spikes (e.g., holiday sales).

image::load-balancing-diagram.png

*Scenario A: Auto-Scaling under Load*
* *Given* the standard server capacity handles 1,000 concurrent users
* *When* traffic spikes to 5,000 concurrent users (simulated via load testing tools)
* *Then* the cloud infrastructure should automatically provision additional instances
* *And* the page load time should remain under *2 seconds*
* *And* no "503 Service Unavailable" errors should be returned.

*Scenario B: Failover Redundancy*
* *Given* the primary database region experiences an outage
* *When* a user attempts to confirm a booking
* *Then* the system should automatically switch to the secondary failover region
* *And* the transaction should complete successfully without data loss.

== User Interface Design
Planning a website or web app involves numerous steps. 
* First, you
need to understand the goals for the site and the target users. 
* Then, you will sketch
out the website’s blueprint and plan how users will move around. This is often known
as the prototype or wireframe.
* After this, it’s about making it look good by picking colors, fonts, and snazzy graphics
that show off what the brand’s all about. Of course, you need some catchy words and
cool pictures or videos to tell your story. 
* Then comes the geeky part, where you turn
all these ideas into a real, working website using languages like HTML, CSS, and Java‐
Script.

ChatGPT::
Below is a risk-based analysis of the provided code, focused on Performance, Security, and Interoperability.

Performance Risks

Synchronous External Messaging Call – Performance –
messageRequests.postMessage(message) appears to be a synchronous external call. If the messaging service is slow or unavailable, booking creation may be delayed, increasing response time and reducing system throughput.

Multiple Database Calls per Booking – Performance –
The method performs at least two database operations (checkForBookingConflict and create). Under high load, this could lead to performance degradation if not optimized or wrapped in a transaction.

No Short-Circuit for Notification Logic – Performance –
Message construction and sending are performed immediately after booking creation. If notifications are optional, performing them inline may unnecessarily slow down the booking flow.

Security Risks

Lack of Input Validation on Booking Object – Security –
The method assumes bookingToCreate and its fields (email, phone, booking dates) are valid. Missing validation may allow malformed or malicious input to propagate to the database or messaging systems.

Potential SQL Injection Risk – Security –
The method throws SQLException, but there is no evidence that bookingDB uses prepared statements. If user input is directly used in SQL queries, this could introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Sensitive Data Exposure via Messaging – Security –
Email and phone number data are passed to an external messaging system without indication of encryption, masking, or consent checks, potentially exposing personally identifiable information (PII).

Missing Authorization Checks – Security –
There is no verification that the caller is authorized to create a booking, which could allow unauthorized users or systems to create bookings.

Interoperability Risks

Tight Coupling to Messaging Implementation – Interoperability –
The method directly instantiates MessageBuilder and calls messageRequests.postMessage, making it harder to integrate with alternative messaging providers or change protocols.

No Handling of Messaging Failures – Interoperability –
If the messaging service is unavailable or returns an error, there is no fallback, retry, or compensation logic, which may cause inconsistent behavior across integrated systems.

Implicit Dependency on External Systems – Interoperability –
Successful booking creation partially depends on external systems (database, messaging). Differences in data formats, availability, or response behavior may impact system-to-system compatibility.

Summary

The main risks in this method are related to synchronous external dependencies, insufficient validation and security controls, and tight coupling to external services, all of which could negatively impact performance, security, and interoperability as the system scales or integrates with other platforms.

Gemini::
As a software testing expert, I have analyzed the provided createBooking method. The code reveals several critical vulnerabilities regarding how it handles data, external dependencies, and database transactions.

Here are the identified risks:
Performance

    Synchronous External Blocking - Performance - The method calls messageRequests.postMessage(message) directly within the execution flow. If the external messaging service is slow or unresponsive, the entire booking transaction remains open, leading to thread exhaustion and increased latency for the user.

    Database Race Conditions - Performance - The "check-then-act" pattern (checking for conflict, then creating) without explicit locking mechanisms can lead to performance degradation under high concurrency as the database struggles with contention or duplicate entries that require rollback.

    Sequential Execution - Performance - The notification logic (MessageBuilder and postMessage) is performed sequentially. In a high-traffic B&B platform, this adds unnecessary overhead to the main execution thread that should focus solely on the database transaction.

Security

    SQL Injection Vulnerability - Security - The bookingToCreate object is passed directly into bookingDB methods. If these methods do not use prepared statements or proper parameterization, an attacker could use malicious input in fields like "name" or "notes" to execute unauthorized SQL commands.

    Insecure Data Transmission - Security - The code checks for the existence of Email and Phone but does not appear to sanitize or encrypt this PII (Personally Identifiable Information) before passing it to the MessageBuilder and messageRequests. This increases the risk of data exposure if the messaging logs or external service are compromised.

    Improper Error Handling - Security - The method throws SQLException. If the calling layer does not catch this and sanitize the output, raw database error messages (containing table names or schema details) could be leaked to the end-user.

Interoperability

    Tight Coupling with Messaging Service - Interoperability - The core booking logic is strictly dependent on the messageRequests implementation. If the external API changes its signature or data format, the createBooking method will fail, preventing any bookings from being processed.

    Lack of Fault Tolerance - Interoperability - There is no retry logic or circuit breaker for the external postMessage call. If the messaging system is down, the booking might be created in the DB, but the failure of the message service could potentially crash the process or leave the system in an inconsistent state.

Summary of Risk Impact

The most severe risk here is Performance, specifically the synchronous call to an external messaging service. This is a "bottleneck" pattern that often causes applications to crash under load because the database connection stays tied up while waiting for a network response from a third party.

Would you like me to rewrite this code snippet using an Asynchronous pattern (such as a Message Queue) to mitigate the performance and interoperability risks identified?
======

the quality of these different risks varies. For example, the risk “Performance - Message Posting” feels quite abstract, as we can see in its explanation:
---
If the message posting process involves network communication or I/O operations, it 
could slow down the execution of the createBooking method.
---
Suggesting risks around network communication or I/O operations feels vague 
because it might refer to a range of implementations, some of which might relate to 
our work and some that might not.
However, other risks are more concrete and potentially useful—for example, 
---
“Security - Inadequate Authorization,” which highlights the following:
The code does not perform explicit authorization checks before creating bookings, 
potentially allowing unauthorized users to create bookings.
---
This risk feels more concrete because it refers to actions that are carried out in our 
method and the absence of potentially important checks within it. Of course, we may 
carry out authorization checks elsewhere, but the information it has given highlighted 
an explicit activity that we might need to discuss further to improve the security of our 
booking feature.

if we want to solicit more questions and risks? We simply ask by submitting an additional prompt, such as “Generate more questions” or “Identify further risks.”  Be wary, though, as this has diminishing returns. An LLM will try to fulfill 
our requests at the risk of increasing hallucinations. So, as options start to dry out, we 
may see more suggestions that are less connected to the ideas and code we wanted 
feedback on in the first place.

== Unit Testing
Prompt: For this program, suggest unit tests to correctly calculate the total amount,
check the typical and edge cases, such as zero and negative bill amounts and high tip

features, bugs, and customer service. Also, do sentiment analysis on this file. Based on
the frequency and severity of issues mentioned, help prioritize which bugs to fix first
or which features to consider adding. With all this, create a report that includes charts.

Another way ChatGPT can help is with response drafting. If you’re dealing with cus‐
tomer feedback, it can help you write better responses, such as by creating templates
for answers to common questions. This way, you’re always on point and professional
when you’re chatting with users or customers.

you can use ChatGPT for more personalized responses. You can cut-and-paste
user email and use a prompt like this:
Prompt: Write a reply to the user email, focusing on a calm and understanding tone.
Make sure the response is friendly and helps to ease any concerns without escalating
the situation. {email}

you can create your own LLM-based application(i.e using the OpenAI API) to handle user feedback(i.e categorize and prioritize the incoming feedback).
