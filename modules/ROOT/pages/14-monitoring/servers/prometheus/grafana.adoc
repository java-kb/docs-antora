= Grafana log visualization

Just as you browsed
logs using Loki as a data source for Grafana, you can query metrics using Prometheus
as a data source. Furthermore, you can use the metrics stored by Prometheus to
define dashboards, graphically visualize data, and set alarms or notifications when certain metrics return known critical values. For example, when the rate of failing HTTP
requests per minute goes above a certain threshold, you might want to get an alarm or
a notification so you can act on it.
