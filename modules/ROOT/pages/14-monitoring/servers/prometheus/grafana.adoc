= Grafana log visualization

Just as you browsed
logs using Loki as a data source for Grafana, you can query metrics using Prometheus
as a data source. Furthermore, you can use the metrics stored by Prometheus to
define dashboards, graphically visualize data, and set alarms or notifications when cer-
tain metrics return known critical values. For example, when the rate of failing HTTP
requests per minute goes above a certain threshold, you might want to get an alarm or
a notification so you can act on it.
