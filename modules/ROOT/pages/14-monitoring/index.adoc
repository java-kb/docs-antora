Add a service, which would gather statistics about individual operations. Aggregate metrics in centralized metrics service, which provides reporting and alerting. There are two models for aggregating metrics:

* push: the service pushes metrics to the metrics service
* pull: the metrics services pulls metrics from the service

Prometheus and AWS Cloud Watch are Metrics aggregation services.

Application Metrics pattern provides deep insight into application behavior, but the Aggregating metrics can require significant infrastructure.
