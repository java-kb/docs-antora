*Gateway: Configure Service Discovery and Load Balancing in the Gateway*

All you need to do to take advantage of these new patterns is add some configuration
to the application.yml file. We divide the changes into three groups.

* Global settings: Name the application and make sure you use the
Spring Cloud load balancer implementation. Besides, you'll add a
configuration parameter to instruct the service discovery client to
retrieve only the healthy services.
* Routing configuration: Instead of using explicit hosts and ports,
switch to service names with a URL pattern that also enables load
balancing
* Resilience: In case the gateway fails to proxy a request to a service, you
want it to retry a few times. We elaborate on this topic in a bit.

  application:
    name: gateway
    # the Gateway microservice connects to Consul to find the available instances of other microservices and their network locations. Then,
    # it balances the load based on a simple round-robin algorithm included in Spring Cloud load balancer
    loadbalancer:
      # Since  Netflix’s Ribbon in maintenance mode, let’s discard that option and choose the Spring’s load balancer implementation
      ribbon:

        enabled: true
      discovery:
        # instruct the service discovery client to retrieve only the healthy services
        # With the query-passing parameter set to true, the Spring implementation will use
        # the Consul API with a filter to retrieve only those services that have a passing health check
        query-passing: true
        # Given that you added the Consul starter, the Gateway service is also registering itself
        # in Consul. That is not strictly necessary since other services won’t call the gateway, but
        # it’s still useful to check its status. Alternatively, you could set the configuration parameter
        # spring.cloud.consul.discovery.register to false to keep using the service discovery
        # client features but disable the registration of the Gateway service.
        register: true

        #at http://localhost:8080/. The same will happen to other
        #API contexts located in the same microservice, like challenges
        #and users.

          # Instead of using explicit hosts and ports, switch to service names with a URL pattern that also enables load balancing.
          # Since you added the Consul client, the application will use the Service API to resolve the service name, multiplication, to the available
          # instances. The lb:// prefix tells Spring that it should use the load balancer.
          #The ReactiveLoadBalancerClientFilter looks for a URI in the exchange attribute named ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_REQUEST_URL_ATTR.
          #If the URL has a lb scheme (such as lb://myservice), it uses the Spring Cloud ReactorLoadBalancer to resolve the name (myservice in this example)
          #to an actual host and port and replaces the URI in the same attribute. The unmodified original URL is appended to the list in the
          #ServerWebExchangeUtils.GATEWAY_ORIGINAL_REQUEST_URL_ATTR attribute

        # the Retry GatewayFilter intercepts error responses and transparently retries the request again. When combined with a load balancer,
        # this means the request will be proxied to the next instance, so you get a nice resilience
        # pattern (retry) easily. You configure this filter to make three retries maximum for the
        # HTTP methods you’re using, which is more than enough to cover most failure situations.
        # If all the retries fail, the gateway returns an error response to the client (service
        # unavailable) because it can’t proxy the request
