= Service Discovery
:figures: 07-discovery

In the cloud, you’ll probably want to have multiple instances of a service running, and
each service instance will have its own IP address. Unlike physical machines or long-
running virtual machines, a service instance will not live long in the cloud. Applica-
tion instances are disposable—they can be removed or replaced for different reasons,
such as when they are not responsive anymore. You can even enable the auto-scaling
feature to automatically scale your application in and out, depending on the workload.
Using IP addresses for interprocess communication in the cloud is not an option. To overcome that issue, you might consider using DNS records, relying on a
round-robin name resolution pointing to one of the IP addresses assigned to the rep-
licas. Knowing the hostname, you can reach the backing service even if one of the IP
addresses changes because the DNS server would be updated with the new ones. How-
ever, this approach is not the best fit for cloud environments because the topology
changes too often. Some DNS implementations cache the results of name lookups
even after they should have expired. Similarly, some applications cache DNS lookup
responses for too long. Either way, there’s a high chance of using a hostname/IP
address resolution that is no longer valid.

Service discovery in cloud environments requires a different solution. First, we
need to keep track of all the service instances running and store that information in a
service registry. Whenever a new instance is created, an entry should be added to the
registry. When it’s shut down, it should be removed accordingly. The registry recog-
nizes that multiple instances of the same application can be up and running. When an
application needs to call a backing service, it performs a lookup in the registry to deter-
mine which IP address to contact. If multiple instances are available, a load-balancing
strategy is applied to distribute the workload across them.


The service discovery pattern consists of two main concepts.

* The service registry:
A central place with a list of available services,
the address where they're located, and some extra metadata like their
name. It may contain entries for different services, but also multiple
instances of the same service. In the last case, clients accessing
the registry can obtain a list of available instances by querying a
service alias. For example, various instances of the Multiplication
microservice can register with the same alias, multiplication. Then,
when querying that value, all instances are returned.
* The registrar:
The logic in charge of registering the service instance at
the registry. It can be an external running process observing the state
of your microservice, or it can be embedded in the service itself as a
library, like it'll be this case.

== Client-side discovery

Other services may query a given service name from the registry, retrieve a list, and
then decide which instance to call. This technique is known as client-side discovery,
and it implies that clients are aware of the service registry and perform load balancing
themselves. Note that, by client, we mean an application, microservice, browser, and so
on, that wants to perform an HTTP call to another service

Client-side service discovery requires applications to register themselves with a service
registry upon startup and unregister when shutting down. Whenever they need to call
a backing service, they ask the service registry for an IP address. If multiple instances are available, the registry will return the list of IP addresses. The application will
choose one of them, depending on a load-balancing strategy defined by the applica-
tion itself.

A benefit of such a solution is that your applications have complete control
over the load-balancing strategy. Suppose you need to implement patterns like hedging:sending the same request to multiple instances to increase the chance one responds
correctly within a specific time limit. Client service discovery can help you with that.

A drawback is that client service discovery assigns more responsibility to develop-
ers. If your system includes applications built using different languages and frame-
works, you’ll need to handle the client part of each of them in different ways. Also, it
results in one more service to deploy and maintain (the service registry), unless you
use PaaS solutions like Azure Spring Apps or VMware Tanzu Application Service,
which provide it for you. Server-side discovery solutions solve these issues at the expense
of fine-grained control in the application.

== Server-side discovery

On the other side, server-side discovery abstracts all this logic from the clients by
providing a unique address, known in advance, where callers can find a given service.
When they make the request, it's intercepted by a load balancer, which is aware of the
registry. This balancer will proxy the request to one of the replicas

Server-side service discovery solutions move a lot of responsibility to the deployment
platform, so that developers can focus on the business logic and rely on the platform
to provide all the necessary functionality for service discovery and load balancing.
Such solutions automatically register and deregister application instances and rely on
a load-balancer component to route any incoming requests to one of the available
instances according to a specific strategy. In this case, the application doesn’t need to
interact with the service registry, which is updated and managed by the platform.

The service registration process is handled by the platform transparently.]

Typically, in a microservices architecture, you'll see either both approaches
combined or just server-side discovery. Client-side discovery doesn't work well when
the API clients are outside your system, because you shouldn't require external clients to
interact with a service registry and do load balancing themselves. Normally, the gateway
takes this responsibility. Therefore, your API gateway will be connected to the service
registry and will include a load balancer to distribute the load across the instances.
