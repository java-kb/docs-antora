= Service Discovery
:figures: 07-discovery

The service discovery pattern consists of two main concepts.

* The service registry:
A central place with a list of available services,
the address where they're located, and some extra metadata like their
name. It may contain entries for different services, but also multiple
instances of the same service. In the last case, clients accessing
the registry can obtain a list of available instances by querying a
service alias. For example, various instances of the Multiplication
microservice can register with the same alias, multiplication. Then,
when querying that value, all instances are returned.
* The registrar:
The logic in charge of registering the service instance at
the registry. It can be an external running process observing the state
of your microservice, or it can be embedded in the service itself as a
library, like it'll be this case.

== Client-side discovery

Other services may query a given service name from the registry, retrieve a list, and
then decide which instance to call. This technique is known as client-side discovery,
and it implies that clients are aware of the service registry and perform load balancing
themselves. Note that, by client, we mean an application, microservice, browser, and so
on, that wants to perform an HTTP call to another service

== Server-side discovery

On the other side, server-side discovery abstracts all this logic from the clients by
providing a unique address, known in advance, where callers can find a given service.
When they make the request, it's intercepted by a load balancer, which is aware of the
registry. This balancer will proxy the request to one of the replicas

Typically, in a microservices architecture, you'll see either both approaches
combined or just server-side discovery. Client-side discovery doesn't work well when
the API clients are outside your system, because you shouldn't require external clients to
interact with a service registry and do load balancing themselves. Normally, the gateway
takes this responsibility. Therefore, your API gateway will be connected to the service
registry and will include a load balancer to distribute the load across the instances.
