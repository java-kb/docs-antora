= Kubernetes Service Discovery
:figures: 07-discovery/servers 

Kubernetes provides a native service-discovery and load-balancing feature that
you can use through the Service objects.

The Kubernetes implementation of service discovery pattern is based on Service
objects. A Service is “an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods
as a network service”

A Service object is an abstraction targeting a set of Pods (typically using labels) and
defining the access policy. When an application needs to contact a Pod exposed by a Service object, it can use the Service name instead of calling the Pod directly. 

The IP address assigned to a Service is fixed for its lifetime. Therefore,
the DNS resolution of a Service name doesn’t change as often as it would with
application instances.

After resolving the Service name to its IP address, Kubernetes relies on a proxy (called
kube-proxy), which intercepts the connection to the Service object and forwards the
request to one of the Pods targeted by the Service. The proxy knows all the replicas
available and adopts a load-balancing strategy depending on the type of Service and
the proxy configuration. There is no DNS resolution involved in this step.

a Service object. Any request arriving at the Service is intercepted by a proxy that forwards it to one of the replicas targeted by the Service based on a specific load-balancing strategy.]

Kubernetes Services let you expose a set of
Pods via an interface that other applications can call without knowing the details
about the individual Pod instances. This model provides applications with transparent
service-discovery and load-balancing functionality.

This solution is transparent to your Spring Boot applications. Unlike options like
Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka, you get service discovery and load balancing out of the
box in Kubernetes, without requiring any change to your code. That’s why it’s the preferred option when you use a Kubernetes-based platform to deploy your applications.

there are different types of Services, depending on which access policy
you want to enforce for the application. The default and most common type is called
ClusterIP, and it exposes a set of Pods to the cluster. This is what makes it possible for
Pods to communicate with each other (for example, Catalog Service and PostgreSQL).

Four pieces of information characterize a ClusterIP Service:

* The selector label used to match all the Pods that should be targeted and
exposed by the Service
* The network protocol used by the Service
* The port on which the Service is listening (we’re going to use port 80 for all
our application Services)
* The targetPort, which is the port exposed by the targeted Pods to which the
Service will forward requests

== DEFINING A SERVICE MANIFEST WITH YAML
To define a manifest for a Service object to expose the Catalog Service application through the DNS name catalog-service and port 80 use

catalog-service/k8s/service.yml
[source,yaml,attributes]    
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  # The name of the Service; it must be a valid DNS name.
  name: catalog-service
  labels:
    app: catalog-service
spec:
  # The type of Service
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    #The label used to match the Pods to target and expose
    app: catalog-service
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      #The port exposed by the Service
      port: 80
      # The port exposed by the Pods targeted by the Service
      targetPort: 9001
----
Open a Terminal window, navigate to your Catalog Service root folder (catalog-service), and run the following command:
[source,console,attributes]
----
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yml
----
You can verify the result with the following command
[source,console,attributes]
----
kubectl get svc -l app=catalog-service
----

expose the application outside the cluster using the port-forwarding feature offered by Kubernetes to expose an object (in this case, a Service) to a local machine

The process started by the kubectl port-forward command will keep
running until you explicitly stop it with Ctrl-C. Until then, you’ll need to open
another Terminal window if you want to run CLI commands.


[source,console,attributes]
----
kubectl port-forward service/catalog-service 9001:80

Both Catalog Service and PostgreSQL are exposed to the inside of the cluster through the cluster-local hostname,IP address, and port assigned to the Service objects.]
