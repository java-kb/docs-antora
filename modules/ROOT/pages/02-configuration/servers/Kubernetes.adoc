= Kubernetes ConfigMaps
:figures: 02-configuration/servers/kubernetes

_TL;DR: When Spring Boot applications are deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, you can
also configure them through ConfigMaps (for non-sensitive configuration
data) and Secrets (for sensitive configuration data)._

The three strategies stated are generic enough that we can use them to configure applications for any cloud environment and service model (CaaS, PaaS, FaaS). When it
comes to Kubernetes, there’s an additional configuration strategy that is provided
natively by the platform: ConfigMaps and Secrets.

The 15-Factor methodology recommends keeping code, configuration, and creden-
tials always separate. Kubernetes fully embraces that principle and defines two APIs
to handle configuration and credentials independently: ConfigMaps and Secrets.

These are a very convenient way to define configuration data that depends on the
infrastructure and platform where the application is deployed: service names (defined
by Kubernetes Service objects), credentials and certificates for accessing other ser-
vices running on the platform, graceful shutdown, logging, and monitoring. You
could use ConfigMaps and Secrets to complement or completely replace what a con-
figuration service does. Which you choose depends on the context. In any case,
Spring Boot provides native support for all those options.

if we used environment variables to pass hardcoded configuration to containers running in Kubernetes, they will lack maintainability and structure. ConfigMaps let you store configuration data in a structured, maintainable way. They can be
version-controlled together with the rest of your Kubernetes deployment manifests
and have the same nice properties of a dedicated configuration repository, including
data persistence, auditing, and accountability.

A ConfigMap is “an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value
pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume” (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap).

You can build a ConfigMap starting with a literal key/value pair string, with a file
(for example, .properties or .yml), or even with a binary object. When working with Spring Boot applications, the most straightforward way to build a ConfigMap is to
start with a property file.

The values stored in a ConfigMap can be used to configure containers running in a
few different ways:

- Use a ConfigMap as a configuration data source to pass command-line argu-
ments to the container.
- Use a ConfigMap as a configuration data source to populate environment vari-
ables for the container.
- Mount a ConfigMap as a volume in the container.

Passing configuration data as command-line arguments or environment
variables to containers has its drawbacks, even if it is stored in a ConfigMap. For example, whenever you add a property to a ConfigMap, you must update the Deployment
manifest. When a ConfigMap is changed, the Pod is not informed about it and must
be re-created to read the new configuration. Both those issues are solved by mounting
ConfigMaps as volumes. When a ConfigMap is mounted as a volume to a container, it generates two possible outcomes:

- If the ConfigMap includes an embedded property file, mounting it as a volume
results in the property file being created in the mounted path. Spring Boot
automatically finds and includes any property files located in a /config folder
either in the same root as the application executable or in a subdirectory, so it’s
the perfect path for mounting a ConfigMap. You can also specify additional
locations to search for property files via the spring.config.additional-loca-
tion=<path> configuration property.
- If the ConfigMap includes key/value pairs, mounting it as a volume results in a
config tree being created in the mounted path. For each key/value pair, a file is created, named like the key and containing the value. Spring Boot supports
reading configuration properties from a config tree. You can specify where the
config tree should be loaded from via the spring.config.import=config-
tree:<path> property.

When configuring Spring Boot applications, the first option is the most convenient,
since it uses the same property file format used for the default configuration inside
the application. 

== Integration with Spring boot
Spring Boot provides native and flexible support for both ConfigMaps and Secrets.

create a new configmap.yml file in the k8s folder. We’ll use it to apply the following configuration, which
will overwrite the default values included in the application.yml file packaged with the application:

[source,yml,attributes]
----
apiVersion: v1 
kind: ConfigMap 
metadata:
    name: catalog-config 
    labels: 
        app: catalog-service
data: 
    application.yml: | 
        polar:
            greeting: Welcome to the book catalog from a development Kubernetes environment!
        spring:
            datasource:
                url: jdbc:postgresql://polar-postgres/polardb_catalog
            security:
                oauth2:
                resourceserver:
                    jwt:
                    issuer-uri: http://polar-keycloak/realms/PolarBookshop
----

apply

kubectl apply -f k8s/configmap.yml

verify that the ConfigMap has been created correctly with this command:

kubectl get cm -l app=catalog-service

go to the deployment.yml
file in the k8s folder. We need to apply three changes:

- Remove the environment variables for the values we declared in the ConfigMap.
- Declare a volume generated from the catalog-config ConfigMap.
- Specify a volume mount for the catalog-service container to load the Config-
Map as an application.yml file from /workspace/config. The /workspace folder
is created and used by Cloud Native Buildpacks to host the application execut-
ables, so Spring Boot will automatically look for a /config folder in the same
path and load any property files contained within. There’s no need to configure
additional locations.

deploy the application in the local cluster by applying the Deployment and Service manifests:

``kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yml -f k8s/service.yml``

verify when Catalog Service is available and ready to accept requests with this command:

``kubectl get deploy -l app=catalog-service``

forward traffic from your local machine to the Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:

``kubectl port-forward service/catalog-service 9001:80``

verify that the polar.greeting value specified in the ConfigMap is used instead of the default one:

``http :9001/``

==  Refreshing configuration at runtime with Spring Cloud Kubernetes
When using an external configuration service, you’ll probably want a mechanism to
reload the applications when configuration changes. For example, when using Spring
Cloud Config, we can implement such a mechanism with Spring Cloud Bus.

In Kubernetes, we need a different approach. When you update a ConfigMap or a
Secret, Kubernetes takes care of providing containers with the new versions when
they’re mounted as volumes. If you use environment variables, they will not be
replaced with the new values. That’s why we usually prefer the volume solution.

The updated ConfigMaps or Secrets are provided to the Pod when they’re mounted
as volumes, but it’s up to the specific application to refresh the configuration. By
default, Spring Boot applications read configuration data only at startup time. There
are three main options for refreshing configuration when it’s provided through Config-
Maps and Secrets:

=== Rolling restart
Changing a ConfigMap or a Secret can be followed by a rolling
restart of all the Pods affected, making the applications reload all the configura-
tion data. With this option, Kubernetes Pods would remain immutable.

We can rely on Kustomize to trigger a
restart of the applications whenever a new change is applied to a ConfigMap or a
Secret.
=== Spring Cloud Kubernetes Configuration Watcher
Spring Cloud Kubernetes pro-
vides a Kubernetes controller called Configuration Watcher that monitors Config-
Maps and Secrets mounted as volumes to Spring Boot applications. Leveraging
the Spring Boot Actuator’s /actuator/refresh endpoint or Spring Cloud Bus,
when any of the ConfigMaps or Secrets is updated, the Configuration Watcher
will trigger a configuration refresh for the affected applications.
- Spring Cloud Kubernetes Config Server—Spring Cloud Kubernetes provides a con-
figuration server with support for using ConfigMaps and Secrets as one of the
configuration data source options for Spring Cloud Config. You could use such
a server to load configuration from both a Git repository and Kubernetes objects,
with the possibility of using the same configuration refresh mechanism for both.
