= Spring Cloud Config Server
:figures: 02-configuration/servers

The Spring ecosystem offers many options to externalize configuration. We can categorize
them into three groups.

* *Configuration services*--The Spring Cloud project provides modules you can
use to run your own configuration services and configure your Spring Boot
applications.
* *Spring Cloud Alibaba* provides a configuration service using Alibaba Nacos
as the data store.
* *Spring Cloud Config* provides a configuration service backed by a pluggable
data source, such as a Git repository, a data store, or HashiCorp Vault.
* *Spring Cloud Consul* provides a configuration service using HashiCorp Con-
sul as the data store.
* *Spring Cloud Vault* provides a configuration service using HashiCorp Vault
as the data store.
* *Spring Cloud Zookeeper* provides a configuration service using Apache Zoo-
keeper as the data store.
* *Cloud vendor services*--If you run your applications on a platform provided by a
cloud vendor, you might consider using one of their configuration services.
Spring Cloud provides integration with the main cloud vendor configuration
services that you can use to configure your Spring Boot applications.
* *Spring Cloud AWS* provides integration with AWS Parameter Store and AWS
Secrets Manager.
* *Spring Cloud Azure* provides integration with Azure Key Vault.
* *Spring Cloud GCP* provides integration with GCP Secret Manager.
* *Cloud platform services*--When running your applications on a Kubernetes platform, you can seamlessly use ConfigMaps and Secrets to configure Spring Boot.

Your choice of configuration service will depend on your infrastructure and requirements. For example, suppose you’re running your workloads
on Azure already, and you need a GUI to manage configuration data. In that
case, it might make sense to use Azure Key Vault rather than running a configuration service yourself. If you want to version-control your configuration
data with Git, Spring Cloud Config or Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets
would be a better choice. You might even compromise and use a managed
Spring Cloud Config service offered by vendors like Azure or VMware Tanzu.

The configuration server pattern for Spring is the Spring Cloud Config Server project. This is a native implementation included in the Spring Cloud family, which allows you to keep a set of configuration files distributed in folders and exposed via a REST API

Spring Cloud Config Server is a project that lets you set up a configuration server
with minimal effort. It’s a standard Spring Boot application with specific properties
that enable the configuration server functionality and the Git repository as the con-
figuration data backend. 

On the client side, the projects using this dependency access the config server and request the corresponding configuration resources, depending on their active profiles. The only drawback of this solution is that you need to create another microservice to act as the configuration server and expose the centralized files.

Spring Cloud Config is Spring's client/server approach for storing and serving distributed configurations across multiple applications and environments.

This configuration store is ideally versioned under Git version control and can be modified at application runtime. While it fits very well in Spring applications using all the supported configuration file formats together with constructs like Environment, PropertySource, or @Value, it can be used in any environment running any programming language.

[,java]
----
@Configuration
@PropertySource("classpath:foo.properties")
public class PropertiesWithJavaConfig {
    //...
}

@Value( "${jdbc.url}" )
private String jdbcUrl;

@Autowired
private Environment env;
...
dataSource.setUrl(env.getProperty("jdbc.url"));
----

Spring Cloud Config provides server and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. With the Config Server you have a central place to manage external properties for applications across all environments. The concepts on both client and server map identically to the Spring Environment and PropertySource abstractions, so they fit very well with Spring applications, but can be used with any application running in any language. As an application moves through the deployment pipeline from dev to test and into production you can manage the configuration between those environments and be certain that applications have everything they need to run when they migrate. The default implementation of the server storage backend uses git so it easily supports labelled versions of configuration environments, as well as being accessible to a wide range of tooling for managing the content. It is easy to add alternative implementations and plug them in with Spring configuration.

== Features

*Spring Cloud Config Server features:*

* HTTP, resource-based API for external configuration (name-value pairs, or equivalent YAML content)
* Encrypt and decrypt property values (symmetric or asymmetric)
* Embeddable easily in a Spring Boot application using @EnableConfigServer

*Config Client features (for Spring applications):*

* Bind to the Config Server and initialize Spring Environment with remote property sources
* Encrypt and decrypt property values (symmetric or asymmetric)

The library relies on three parameters to identify which property file to
use to configure a specific application:

* \{application}--The name of the application as defined by the spring.application.name property.
* \{profile}--One of the active profiles defined by the spring.profiles.active
property.
* \{label}--A discriminator defined by the specific configuration data repository.
In the case of Git, it can be a tag, a branch name, or a commit ID. It's useful for
identifying a versioned set of config files.

Depending on your needs, you can organize the folder structure using different combinations, such as these:

* /\{application}/application-\{profile}.yml
* /\{application}/application.yml
* /\{application}-\{profile}.yml
* /\{application}.yml
* /application-\{profile}.yml
* /application.yml

For each application, you can either use property files named after the application itself
and placed in the root folder (e.g., /catalog-service.yml or /catalog-service-prod.yml) or
use the default naming and put them in a subfolder named after the application (e.g.,
/catalog-service/application.yml or /catalog-service/application-prod.yml).

You can also put application.yml or application-{profile}.yml files in the root folder
to define default values for all applications. They can be used as a fallback whenever
there is no more specific property source. Spring Cloud Config Server will always
return the properties from the most specific path, using the application name, active
profiles, and Git labels.

The label concept is particularly interesting when using Git as the backend for the
config server. For example, you could create long-lived branches of your config repo
for different environments or short-lived branches while testing specific features.
Spring Cloud Config Server can use the label information to return the correct con-
figuration data from the right Git branch, tag, or commit ID.


== Rest Endpoints

Spring Cloud Config Server exposes properties through a series of endpoints using
different combinations of the \{application}, \{profile}, and \{label} parameters:

. /\{application}/\{profile}[/\{label}]
. /\{application}-\{profile}.yml
. /\{label}/\{application}-\{profile}.yml
. /\{application}-\{profile}.properties
. /\{label}/\{application}-\{profile}.properties

== Configuration
=== Server Configs
* *spring.cloud.config.server.git.timeout*

scaling the Config Service is not enough. Since it’s using a remote Git
repository as the configuration data backend, you’ll need to make that interaction
more resilient too. First, you can define a timeout to prevent the config server from
waiting too long to establish a connection with the remote repository. You can do so
with the spring.cloud.config.server.git.timeout property.

* *spring.cloud.config.server.git.clone-on-start*

Spring Cloud Config is implemented to clone the remote repository locally upon
the first request for configuration data. I recommend using the spring.cloud.config.server.git.clone-on-start property so that the repo clone happens at startup.
Even though it makes the startup phase a bit slower, it makes your deployment fail
faster if there’s any difficulty communicating with the remote repository, rather than
waiting for the first request to find out that something is wrong. Also, it makes the first
request from a client faster.

* *spring.cloud.config.server.git.force-pull*

When a local copy of the repository is created successfully, there’s a chance the
local repo may get changed independently of the remote repo. You can ensure your
config server always uses the same data that’s defined in the remote repository by set-
ting the spring.cloud.config.server.git.force-pull property so that a fresh copy
is pulled whenever the local copy is corrupted, and any local changes are discarded.

* *spring.cloud.config.server.git.basedir*

By default, the local repository is cloned in a folder with a random name. If needed,
you can control where it is cloned through the spring.cloud.config.server.git.basedir property.

=== Client Configs
* spring.cloud.config.request-connect-timeout

You can use the spring.cloud.config.request-connect-timeout property to control the time limit for establishing a connection with the config server. 

* spring.cloud.config.request-read-timeout

The spring.cloud.config.request-read-timeout property lets you limit the time spent reading configuration data from the server.

== Making the configuration server resilient

Spring Cloud Config is implemented to clone the remote repository locally upon
the first request for configuration data. The local copy of the repository improves the config server's fault tolerance because it ensures it can return configuration data to the client applications even if the communication with the remote repository is temporarily failing (for example, if GitHub is down or there’s a problem with the network). However, if the config server
hasn’t cloned the repository locally yet, there’s no fallback in place. That’s why it’s bet-
ter to fail fast at startup and investigate the issue right away.

to ensure it's highly available:

* deploying multiple instances of Config Service in a production environment. If one of them stops working for some reason, another replica can provide the required configuration.
* If it's using a remote Git repository as the configuration data backend, you'll need to make that interaction more resilient too.
 ** First, you can define a timeout to prevent the config server from waiting too long to establish a connection with the remote repository. You can do so with the spring.cloud.config.server.git.timeout property.
 ** using the spring.cloud.config.server.git.clone-on-start property so that the repo clone happens at startup.Even though it makes the startup phase a bit slower, it makes your deployment fail faster if there's any difficulty communicating with the remote repository, rather than waiting for the first request to find out that something is wrong. Also, it makes the first request from a client faster.

== Making the configuration client resilient

When the integration with the config server is not optional, the application fails to
start up if it cannot contact a config server. If the server is up and running, you could still experience issues due to the distributed nature of the interaction. Therefore it's a good idea to define some timeouts to make the application fail faster. You can use the *spring.cloud.config.request-connect-timeout* property to control the time limit for establishing a connection with the config server. The spring.cloud.config.request-
read-timeout property lets you limit the time spent reading configuration data from
the server.

Even if Config Service is replicated, there's still a chance it will be temporarily unavailable when a client application like Catalog Service starts up. In that scenario, you can leverage the retry pattern and configure the application to try again to connect with the config server before giving up and failing.

The retry behavior is enabled only when the *spring.cloud.config.fail-fast* property is set to true.

== Refreshing configuration at runtime

Spring Cloud Config gives you the possibility to refresh configuration in client applications at runtime. Whenever a new change is pushed to the configuration repository, you can signal all the applications integrated with the config server, and
they will reload the parts affected by the configuration change.

. Using /actuator/refresh
+
This a simple refresh option consisting of sending a special
POST request to a running Catalog Service instance to trigger the reloading of the con-
figuration data that has changed (hot reload)
+
This functionality is one of those administrative processes described by the 15-Factor methodology. In this case, the strategy adopted for managing the process was to embed it in the applications themselves, with the ability to activate it by calling a specific HTTP endpoint.
+
In production, you’ll probably want a more automated and efficient
way of refreshing configuration than explicitly triggering each application
instance.
+
you can send a POST request to a client application through a specific endpoint that will trigger a RefreshScopeRefreshedEvent inside the application context.
 You can rely on the Spring Boot Actuator project to expose the refresh endpoint by adding a new dependency
  image::{figures}/image-2.png[alt text]
+
[,xml]
----
 <dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
 </dependency>
----
+
The Spring Boot Actuator library configures an /actuator/refresh endpoint that triggers a refresh event. By default, the endpoint is not exposed, so you have to enable it explicitly in the application.yml file
+
[,yml]
----
 management:
   endpoints:
     web:
       exposure:
         #Exposes the /actuator/refresh endpoint through HTTP
         include: refresh
----
+
The refresh event, *RefreshScopeRefreshedEvent*, will have no effect if there is no component listening. You can use the @RefreshScope annotation on any bean you'd like to be reloaded whenever a refresh is triggered. If you defined your custom properties through a *@ConfigurationProperties* bean, it is already listening to *RefreshScopeRefreshedEvent* by default, so you don't need to make any changes to your code.
+
[,java]
----
 @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "custom")
 public class CustomProperties {
----

. When a remote Git repository backs your config server, you can con-
figure a webhook that notifies the config server automatically whenever new
changes are pushed to the repository. In turn, the config server can notify all
client applications through a message broker like RabbitMQ, using Spring
Cloud Bus.

*TODO: Add this features*

Spring Cloud Config has a few features for encrypting properties containing
secrets before storing them in a Git repository. Also, multiple backend solutions can
be used as configuration data repositories, meaning that you could save all the non-
sensitive properties in Git and use HashiCorp Vault to store secrets. Furthermore, the
REST API itself should be protected
