. *What are the four principles of OOP?*+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

The four principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

* *Encapsulation*: This refers to the practice of hiding the internal
 workings of an object and exposing only the necessary functionality.
 The data and behaviour of an object are encapsulated within the
 object, and can only be accessed through well-defined interfaces.
* *Inheritance*: Inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and
 behaviours from other objects. Inheritance allows for the creation of
 hierarchical relationships between classes, with parent classes
 passing down their characteristics to their child classes.
* *Polymorphism*: Polymorphism refers to the abilit y of objects to
 take on many forms, and is achieved through the use of inheritance,
 allows for greater flexibilit y and reuse of code.
* *Abstraction*: Abstraction refers to the process of identifying
 common patterns and extracting essential features of objects,
 creating classes from these patterns. Abstraction allows for the
 creation of higher-level concepts that can be used in multiple
 contexts, and can simplif y complex systems.+++</details>+++

*When to Use:*

*Abstract classes:*

* When you have some common implementation to share among subclasses.
* When you want to enforce a hierarchy and prevent direct instantiation of the base class.
* When you need to control access to members using access modifiers.

*Interfaces:*

* When you want to define a contract that multiple unrelated classes can implement.
* When you want to achieve loose coupling between classes.
* When you need to support multiple inheritance.+++</details>+++
. *What is the use of constructor in an abstract class?*+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

While abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, their
 constructors play a crucial role in object initialization within
 inheritance hierarchies. Here are the key purposes of constructors in
 abstract classes:

* Initializing Member Variables:
* Abstract classes often have member variables that need to
 be initialized for proper object state. Constructors perform
 this initialization, ensuring consistent setup for all
 subclasses.
* Example: An abstract Shape class might have a color
 property initialized in its constructor.
* Enforcing Inv ariants and Constraints:
* Constructors can enforce rules and constraints that must
 hold true for all objects in the hierarchy. This ensures data
 integrity and validity.
* Example: A BankAccount abstract class might require a
 non-negative initial balance in its constructor.
* Shared Initialization Logic:
* Common initialization steps for all subclasses can be
 consolidated in the abstract class constructor, reducing
 code duplication.
* Example: An Employee abstract class might initialize a
 hireDate property in its constructor, shared by all
 employee types.
* Controlling Instantiation:
* Constructors can be made private or protected to control
 how subclasses are created, ensuring they are instantiated
 through specific mechanisms or helper methods.
* Example: A Singleton abstract class might have a private
 constructor to enforce a single instance.
* Calling Superclass Constructors:
* Subclasses must call their superclass constructor (implicitly
 or explicitly) during their own construction. This ensures
 proper initialization of inherited state.
* Example: A SavingsAccount subclass must call the
 BankAccount constructor to initialize shared account
 properties.

Key Points:

* Abstract class constructors are not used for object creation
 directly, but they are invoked when a subclass object is
 created.
* They ensure consistent initialization and enforce class
 invariants, promoting code reusabilit y and maintainability.
* Understanding constructor behaviour in abstract classes is
 essential for effective object-oriented design.+++</details>+++
. *What is abstraction, and what are its advantages?*+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

(Concrete class doing the same what is the advantage over concrete class?)
 Abstraction is a fundamental concept in programming and many
 other fields. In simplest terms, it's the act of focusing on the
 essential details of something while hiding awa y the unnecessary
 complexity . Here's a breakdown of abstraction in programming:

*What is it?*

* Abstraction allows you to break down complex systems
 into smaller, easier-to-understand pieces.
* You define interfaces or classes that expose only the
 relevant functionalities, hiding the inner workings.
* This lets you work with the system at a higher level,
 without getting bogged down in the low-level details.
 *Think of it this way:*
* Imagine a car. You don't need to understand the intricate
 mechanics of the engine to drive it. You just need to know
 how to steer, accelerate, and brake.
* Similarly, when using an abstraction in programming, you
 don't need to know how it works internally. You simply call
 its functions or methods and interact with it at a higher
 level.

*Advantages of abstraction:*

* Reduced complexity: It makes your code easier to
 understand, write, and maintain by breaking down large
 problems into smaller, more manageable chunks.
* Increased productivity: You can focus on the logic and
 functionalit y of your program without getting bogged
 down in implementation details.
* Improved reusability: Abstracted components can be used
 in multiple parts of your program, reducing code
 duplication and promoting modularity.
* Enhanced readability: Code becomes more concise and
 less cluttered, making it easier for others to understand
 and collaborate on.
* Flexibility and adaptability: Abstractions allow you to
 change the underlying implementation without affecting
 the code that uses them.

*Here are some specific examples of abstraction in programming:*

* Functions: They hide the implementation details of a
 specific task and provide a simple interface for other parts
 of your program to interact with.
* Classes: They bundle related data and functionality,
 making it easier to manage and reuse complex data
 structures.
* Libraries and frameworks: They provide pre-built
 abstractions for common tasks, saving you time and effort.+++</details>+++
. *What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?*+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

* *Abstraction:*
 ** Focus: What the object does, hiding implementation  details.
 ** Goal: Simplif ying complex systems by exposing only essential features.
 ** Mechanisms: Abstract classes, interfaces, functions.
* *Encapsulation:*
 ** Focus: How the object's data and behavior are bundled together.
 ** Goal: Protecting data integrity and controlling access.
 ** Mechanisms: Access modifiers (public, private, protected), getters and setters.
* *Key Differences:*
 ** Scope: Abstraction operates at a higher level, focusing on the overall design and interface. Encapsulation works at the object level, managing internal data and implementation.
 ** Purpose: Abstraction aims to simplif y complexity and promote reusability . Encapsulation aims to protect data and manage dependencies.
 ** Implementation: Abstraction is often achieved through abstract classes or interfaces. Encapsulation is typically implemented using access modifiers and methods to control access to data.+++</details>+++
. *What is the difference between Abstraction and polymorphism?*+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

* *Abstraction*
 ** Focus: Hides the internal complexity of an object,
exposing only the essential features and functionalities
that users need to interact with.
 ** Think of it as: A map that shows the important landmarks
of a city without getting bogged down in the details of
every street and alleyway.
 ** *Benefits:*
 ** Simplifies code by reducing cognitive load and making it
 easier to understand.
 ** Promotes code reusabilit y by focusing on general
 functionalities that can be applied in diff erent contexts.
 ** Improves maintainability by making it easier to change the
 implementation details without affecting the code that
 uses the abstraction.
 ** *Mechanisms:*
 ** Abstract classes: Define a blueprint for subclasses with
 shared functionality and abstract methods that must be
 implemented.
 ** Interfaces: Specify contracts that classes must adhere to,
 defining methods without implementation.
 ** Functions: Hide the internal logic of a specific task,
 providing a simple interface for other parts of the program
 to interact with.
* *Polymorphism*
 ** Focus: Enables an object to exhibit diff erent behaviors
depending on its actual type at runtime.
Think of it as: A chameleon that can change its color to
blend in with its surroundings.
 ** *Benefits:*
 ** Makes code more flexible and adaptable by allowing
 diff erent objects to respond diff erently to the same
 message.
 ** Promotes code reusabilit y by enabling generic functions
 and methods that can work with diff erent types of objects.
 ** Improves maintainabilit y by making it easier to add new
 types of objects without modifying existing code.
 ** *Mechanisms:*
 ** Method overloading: Allows a class to define multiple
 methods with the same name but diff erent parameter
 types or numbers.
 ** Method overriding: Allows subclasses to provide their own
 implementation of a method inherited from a superclass.
 ** Interfaces: Can define abstract methods with common
 behavior that diff erent classes can implement in their own
 way.

. *What is the difference between Inheritance and Composition?*+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

* *Inheritance*
+
allows a class (called a subclass) to inherit properties
  and behaviors from another class (called a superclass). The subclass
  can then add or modify these properties and behaviors as needed.
  It's useful for creating hierarchies of related classes and sharing
  code and functionality.
+
For example, if we have an Animal class, a Mammal class, and a Cat
  class, the Cat class can inherit properties and behaviors from both
  Animal and Mammal classes while adding its own specific methods.

 ** *Benefits:*
 ** Promotes code reuse by sharing common functionalities
 among related classes.
 ** Provides code organization by structuring classes in a
 hierarchy.
 ** Enables specialization by adding specific features to
 subclasses.

* *Composition*
+
allows a class to be composed of other objects. This
 means that a class can have references to other objects as its
 properties and use them to delegate tasks or behaviors. It's useful
 for creating complex objects from simpler ones and enabling
 dynamic composition at runtime.
 For instance, a Car class can be composed of objects such as an
 Engine, Wheels, Seats, etc. The Car class can then utilize these
 objects to perform various tasks.

 ** *Benefits:*
 ** Loose coupling between classes -- changes in one class
 usually don't affect the other.
 ** Greater flexibilit y -- allows using functionalities from any
 class, not just parent-child hierarchy.
 ** Promotes modularity and code clarity.

|Feature |Inheritance|Composition|
 |:-----|:-----|:-----|
 |Relationship |"is-a" |"has-a"|
 |Implementation|Subclasses inherit from superclass|Member variables hold other objects|
 |Benefits|Code reuse, organization,specialization|Loose coupling, flexibility,modularity|
 |Drawbacks|Tight coupling, limited flexibility,duplication|Complexity , lifecycle management|+++</details>+++
. *What are Composition and Aggregation with examples?*+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

Composition and aggregation are two types of object-oriented programming concepts that describe the relationship between objects.

* *Composition* is a strong type of association where an object is made
up of one or more objects of other classes. For example, a car is
composed of various parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc.
The car class has an object of the wheel class, engine class, and
transmission class as its member variables.
* *Aggregation*  is a weak type of association where an object
contains a reference to one or more objects of other classes. For
example, a university class has a collection of student classes as its
member variable. The student class has an object of the university
class as its member variable.+++</details>+++
. *What is aggregation, composition, and inheritance?*+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

To check if the current code contains examples of aggregation,
composition, and inheritance, you need to look for the relevant
syntax and usage patterns in the code.

Here are some pointers for identifying these concepts in code:

* *Inheritance*: Look for classes that extend or inherit from other
classes. This is typically indicated by the extends keyword in Java,
for example: public class Car extends Vehicle {...}. Inheritance is
used to create a hierarchy of classes where subclasses inherit
properties and methods from their parent classes.
* *Composition*: Look for objects that contain other objects as instance
variables. This is typically indicated by object instantiation within
another object's constructor, for example:

[,java]
----
  public class Person {
  private Job job;
  public Person(Job job) {
  this.job = job;
  }
  }
----

Composition is used to build complex objects by combining simpler
  objects.
  Aggregation: Look for objects that have references to other
  objects as instance variables, but do not own or create them. This is
  typically indicated by a "has-a" relationship between objects,
  for example:

[,python]
----
  public class University {
  private List<Studentstudents;
  public University(List<Studentstudents) {
  this.students = students;
  }
  }
----

Aggregation is used to represent relationships between objects
  without tightly coupling them together.+++</details>+++
. *Can you explain multilevel inheritance in Java?*+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in object-oriented
programming (OOP) where a derived class (subclass) is created from
another derived class, which itself was derived from a base class
(superclass).

In multilevel inheritance, each derived class inherits the
characteristics of the class above it in the hierarchy. This means that
a subclass not only has all the features of its immediate superclass,
but also those of all its ancestors up the hierarchy chain.
 Here's an example to illustrate multilevel inheritance:

[,java]
----
  class Animal {
         oid eat() {
  System.out.println("Eating...");
   
  }
  class Dog extends Animal {
    oid bark() {
  System.out.println("Barking...");
   
  }
  class Bulldog extends Dog {
  void guard() {
  System.out.println("Guarding...");
  }
  }
----

In this example, Animal is the base class, Dog is a derived class from
Animal, and Bulldog is a derived class from Dog.
Animal has a single method eat(). Dog inherits eat() from Animal
and adds a new method bark(). Bulldog inherits both eat() and
bark() from Dog and adds a new method guard().
Now, an instance of Bulldog can access all the methods of its
immediate superclass (Dog), as well as all the methods of its
ancestor superclass (Animal). For example:

[,java]
----
  Bulldog bulldog = new Bulldog();
  bulldog.eat();  // output: Eating...
  bulldog.bark(); // output: Barking...
  bulldog.guard(); // output: Guarding...
----

This example demonstrates how multilevel inheritance can be used
to create a hierarchy of classes that inherit and extend behavior
fr om each other. However, it is important to use inheritance
judiciously to avoid creating overly complex and tightly-coupled class
hierarchies.+++</details>+++
. *When do you use encapsulation and abstraction in your project?*+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

Encapsulation and abstraction are two important concepts in objectoriented programming, and they are used in diff erent ways in
diff erent parts of a project.

*Encapsulation* is used to protect the internal state of an object and
to control how other objects can access or modify that state. It is
typically used in data modelling, where we define classes that
represent real-world entities and their properties.

For example, if we were building a system to manage a library, we
might define a Book class that has properties like title, author, and
isbn. We would use encapsulation to ensure that these properties
are not accessible or modifiable from outside the Book class, except
through carefully designed methods like getTitle() and setAuthor().

*Abstraction*, on the other hand, is used to hide the implementation
details of a class or component and to present a simpler, higher-level
interface to other parts of the system. It is typically used in system
design and architecture, where we define components and their
interfaces.

For example, if we were building a web application, we might define
a UserService component that provides methods for creating,
updating, and retrieving user accounts. We would use abstraction to
ensure that other components in the system do not need to know
how the UserService is implemented, but can simply use its interface
to perform the necessary actions.

In general, encapsulation and abstraction are used together in
object-oriented programming to create robust, maintainable, and
scalable systems. Encapsulation is used to protect the internal state
of objects and to control how other objects can access or modify
that state, while abstraction is used to hide the implementation
details of components and to present a simpler, higher-level interface
to other parts of the system.+++</details>+++
. *How do you achieve encapsulation?*+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

Encapsulation is achieved in Java through the use of access
modifiers and getter and setter methods.

Access modifiers control the visibility of variables and
methods in a class. There are three access modifiers in Java:
public, private, and protected.

* *Public*: Public variables and methods can be accessed from
anywhere in the program.
* *Private*: Private variables and methods can only be accessed within
the same class.
* *Protected*: Protected variables and methods can be accessed within
the same class, and by subclasses and classes in the same package.

By default, if you don't specify an access modifier, the variable or
method is considered to have "package" or "default" access, which
means it can be accessed within the same package.

Here's an example of how to use access modifiers to achieve
encapsulation:

[,java]
----
  public class Person {
  private String name;
  private int age;
  public String getName() {
       return name;
  }
  public void setName(String name) {
  this.name = name;
  }
  public int getAge() {
  return age;
  }
  public void setAge(int age) {
  if (age < 0) {
  throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be
  negative");
  }
  this.age = age;
  }
  }
----

In this example, the Person class has two private variables, name
and age. These variables are not directly accessible from outside the
class, which means that other classes cannot modify or access them
directly.

To allow other classes to access these variables, we provide public
getter and setter methods for name and age. The getter methods
allow other classes to retrieve the values of these variables, while
the setter methods allow other classes to modify their values.

Note that we can also add validation logic to the setter methods to
ensure that the values being set are valid. In this example, the
setAge method throws an exception if the age is negative.

By using access modifiers and getter and setter methods, we can
achieve encapsulation in Java. This allows us to protect the data and behavior of our objects and prevent other objects from accessing or
modifying them directly, which makes our code more robust and
maintainable.+++</details>+++
. *Given the following class declarations:*
+
[,java]
----
 // Classes
 class Foo {
 private int i;
 public void f() { /* ... */ }
 public void g() { /* ... */ }
 }
 class Bar extends Foo {

Which of the following statements can be inserted at (1) without causing a compile-time error?
+
Select the two correct answers.
+
(a) b.f();
+
(b) a.j = 5;
+
(c) a.g();
+
(d) b.i = 3;+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

(a) and (c)

Bar is a subclass of Foo that overrides the method g().

The statement a.j = 5 is not legal, since the member j in the class Bar cannot be accessed through a Foo reference.

The statement b.i = 3 is not legal either, since the private member i cannot be accessed from outside of the class Foo.+++</details>+++

. *Given the following code:*
+
[,java]
----
 class A {
 void doIt() {}
 }
 class B extends A {
 void doIt() {}
 }
 class C extends B {
 void doIt() {}
 void callUp() {
 // (1) INSERT EXPRESSION HERE
 }
 }
----
+

 Select the one correct answer.
+
(a) doIt();

+
(e) A.this.doIt();
+
(f) ((A) this).doIt();
+
(g) It is not possible.+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

(g)

It is not possible to invoke the doIt() method in A from an instance method in class C. The method in C needs to call a method in a superclass two levels up in the inheritance hierarchy.

The super.super.doIt() strategy will not work, since super is a keyword and cannot be used as an ordinary reference, nor accessed like a field.

If the member to be accessed had been a field or a static method, the solution would be to cast the this reference to the class of the field and use the resulting referenceto access the field, as illustrated in (f). Field access is determined by the declared type of the reference, whereas the instance method to execute is determined by the actual type of the object denoted by the reference at runtime.+++</details>+++

`(g)`

In the class Car, the static method getModelName() hides the static method of the
 same name in the superclass Vehicle. In the class Car, the instance method get RegNo() overrides the instance method of the same name in the superclass Vehicle.
 The declared type of the reference determines the method to execute when a static
 method is called, but the actual type of the object at runtime determines the
 method to execute when an overridden method is called.+++</details>+++

+
(f) MySub(int count) { super(count); this(count, 0); }+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

`(e)`

The class MySuper does not have a no-argument constructor. This means that con structors in subclasses must explicitly call the superclass constructor and provide
 the required parameters. The supplied constructor accomplishes this by calling
 super(num) in its first statement. Additional constructors can accomplish this either
 by calling the superclass constructor directly using the super() call, or by calling
 another constructor in the same class using the this() call which in turn calls the
 superclass constructor. (a) and (b) are not valid, since they do not call the super class constructor explicitly. (d) fails, since the super() call must always be the first
 statement in the constructor body. (f) fails, since the super() and this() calls cannot
 be combined.+++</details>+++

. *Which of the following statements is true?*
+
Select the one correct answer.
+
(a) A super() or this() call must always be provided explicitly as the first state ment in the body of a constructor.
+
(b) If both a subclass and its superclass do not have any declared constructors,
 the implicit default constructor of the subclass will call super() when run.
 (c) If neither super() nor this() is specified as the first statement in the body of a
 constructor, this() will implicitly be inserted as the first statement.
+
(d) If super() is the first statement in the body of a constructor, this() can be
 declared as the second statement.
+
(e) Calling super() as the first statement in the body of a constructor of a subclass
 will always work, since all superclasses have a default constructor.+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

`(b)`

In a subclass without any declared constructors, the implicit default constructor
 will call super().

Use of the super() and this() statements is not mandatory as long
 as the superclass has a no-argument constructor.

If neither super() nor this() is
 declared as the first statement in the body of a constructor, then the default super()
 will implicitly be the first statement.

A constructor body cannot have both a super() and a this() statement.

Calling super() will not always work, since a
 superclass might not have a no-argument constructor.+++</details>+++

 (c) It will print 123 followed by Test.
 (d) It will print 12 followed by Test.
 (e) It will print 4 followed by Test.+++<details>++++++<summary>+++Answer+++</summary>+++

`(d)`

The program will print 12 followed by Test. When the main() method is executed,
 it will create a new instance of B by passing "Test" as an argument. This results in
 a call to the constructor of B that has one String parameter. The constructor does
 not explicitly call any superclass constructor nor any overloaded constructor in B
 using a this() call, but instead the no-argument constructor of the superclass A is
 called implicitly. The no-argument constructor of A calls the constructor in A that
 has two String parameters, passing it the argument list ("1", "2"). This constructor
 calls the constructor with one String parameter, passing the argument "12". This
 constructor prints the argument, after implicitly invoking the no-argument con structor of the superclass Object. Now the execution of all the constructors in A is
 completed, and execution continues in the constructor of B. This constructor now
 prints the original argument "Test" and returns to the main() method.+++</details>+++
