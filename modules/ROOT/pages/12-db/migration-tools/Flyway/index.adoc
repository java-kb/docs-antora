= Flyway
:figures: 12-db/migration-tools/Flyway

Flyway is a tool that provides version control for your database. It offers a single source
of truth for the version of your database's state and keeps track of any changes incre-
mentally. It automates changes and lets you reproduce or roll back the state of a data-
base. Flyway is highly reliable, safe to use in cluster environments, and supports
several relational databases, including the cloud ones like Amazon RDS, Azure Data-
base, and Google Cloud SQL.

At its core, Flyway manages database changes. Any database change is called a migra-
tion, and migrations can be either versioned or repeatable.

* Versioned migrations are
identified by a unique version number and are applied in order exactly once. For
each regular versioned migration, you can also provide an optional undo migration
to revert its effects (in case something goes wrong). They can be used to create,
alter, or drop relational objects like schemas, tables, columns, and sequences or to
correct data.
* On the other hand, repeatable migrations are applied every time their
checksum changes. They can be used for creating or updating views, procedures,
and packages.

Both types of migration can be defined in standard SQL scripts (useful for DDL
changes) or Java classes (useful for DML changes, like data migrations). Flyway keeps
track of which migrations have already been applied through a flyway_schema_history
table automatically created in the database the first time it runs. You can picture
migrations as commits in a Git repository and the schema history table as the reposi-
tory log containing the list of all the commits applied over time

A prerequisite for using Flyway is that both the database you want to
manage and a user with the correct access privileges exist. Once you have a
database and a user, Flyway can manage database changes for you. You
shouldnâ€™t use Flyway to manage users.


== Spring Integeration

You can use Flyway in standalone mode or embedded in a Java application. Spring
Boot provides auto-configuration for it, making it very convenient to include Flyway in
your applications. 

When integrated with Spring Boot, Flyway will search for SQL
migrations in the src/main/resources/db/migration folder and Java migrations in
src/main/java/db/migration.

Flyway expects SQL migration files to comply with a specific naming pattern. Regular versioned migrations should follow this structure:

* Prefix--V for versioned migrations
* Version--Version number using dots or underscores to separate it into multiple
parts (e.g., 2.0.1)
* Separator--Two underscores: __
* Description--Words separated by underscores
* Suffix--.sql

Running schema and data migrations is one of those administrative processes described by the 15-Factor methodology. In this case, the
strategy adopted for managing such a process was to embed it in the application itself. By default, it's activated during the application startup phase.

 author varchar(255) NOT NULL,
 isbn varchar(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
 price float8 NOT NULL,
 title varchar(255) NOT NULL,

 last_modified_date timestamp NOT NULL,
 version integer NOT NULL
);

==  Evolving a database with Flyway
You can evolve a database by adding new migrations to the src/main/resources/db/migration folder. Flyway will automatically detect them and apply them in the correct order.
For example, if you want to add a new column to the book table, you can create a new migration script named V2__Add_publisher_column.sql with the following content:
[source,sql,attributes]
----
ALTER TABLE book ADD COLUMN publisher varchar(255);
----
You can also use Flyway to enforce constraints on existing columns. For example, if you want to make the publisher field mandatory, you can create a new migration script named V3__Make_publisher_mandatory.sql with the following content:
[source,sql,attributes]
----
ALTER TABLE book ALTER COLUMN publisher SET NOT NULL;
----
You can also implement a Java migration to add a default value to the existing rows in the book table that don't have a publisher defined. You can create a new Java class named V3__Make_publisher_mandatory.java with the following content:
[source,java,attributes]
----
package db.migration;
import org.flywaydb.core.api.migration.BaseJavaMigration;
import org.flywaydb.core.api.migration.Context;
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.SQLException;
public class V3__Make_publisher_mandatory extends BaseJavaMigration {
    @Override
    public void migrate(Context context) throws SQLException {
        Connection connection = context.getConnection();
        PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(
            "UPDATE book SET publisher = 'Unknown' WHERE publisher IS NULL");
        statement.executeUpdate();
        statement.close();
    }
}
----
This Java migration will set the publisher field to 'Unknown' for all existing rows in the book table that don't have a publisher defined.
You can then run the Flyway migration by executing the following command:
[source,console]
----
./gradlew flywayMigrate
----
This will apply all the pending migrations in the correct order, including the new ones you just created.

== Adding a new column to an existing table
You can add a new column to an existing table by creating a new migration script. For example, if you want to add a publisher field to the book table, you can create a new migration script named V2__Add_publisher_column.sql with the following content:
[source,sql,attributes]
----
ALTER TABLE book ADD COLUMN publisher varchar(255);
----
You can also implement a Java migration to add a default value to the existing rows in the book table that don't have a publisher defined. You can create a new Java class named V2__Add_publisher_column.java with the following content:
[source,java,attributes]
----
package db.migration;
import org.flywaydb.core.api.migration.BaseJavaMigration;
import org.flywaydb.core.api.migration.Context;
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.SQLException;               
public class V2__Add_publisher_column extends BaseJavaMigration {
    @Override
    public void migrate(Context context) throws SQLException {
        Connection connection = context.getConnection();
        PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(
            "UPDATE book SET publisher = 'Unknown' WHERE publisher IS NULL");
        statement.executeUpdate();
        statement.close();
    }
}
}
----
This Java migration will set the publisher field to 'Unknown' for all existing rows in the book table that don't have a publisher defined. You can then run the Flyway migration by executing the following command:
[source,console]      
----
./gradlew flywayMigrate
----
This will apply all the pending migrations in the correct order, including the new ones you just created.

== Making a field mandatory
You can make a field mandatory by altering the existing column in the table to be NON NULL. For example, if you want to make the publisher field mandatory, you can create a new migration script named V3__Make_publisher_mandatory.sql with the following content:
[source,sql,attributes]
----
ALTER TABLE book ALTER COLUMN publisher SET NOT NULL;
----
You can also implement a Java migration to add a default value to the existing rows in the book table that don't have a publisher defined. You can create a new Java class named V3__Make_publisher_mandatory.java with the following content:

public class V3__Make_publisher_mandatory extends BaseJavaMigration {
    @Override
    public void migrate(Context context) throws SQLException {
        Connection connection = context.getConnection();
        PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(
            "UPDATE book SET publisher = 'Unknown' WHERE publisher IS NULL");
        statement.executeUpdate();
        statement.close();
    }
}

./gradlew flywayMigrate

This two-step approach is very common to ensure backward compatibility during an
upgrade. there are usually multiple instances of the
same application running. Deploying a new version is generally done through a rolling
upgrade procedure consisting of updating one (or a few) instances at a time to ensure
zero downtime. There will be both old and new versions of the application running
during the upgrade, so itâ€™s paramount that the old instances can still run correctly even
after the database changes introduced in the latest version have been applied.
