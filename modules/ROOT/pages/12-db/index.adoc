= Persisting and managing data
:figures: 12-db

Persistence is typically one of the most important topics in any language because it 
provides a way to save information in the long term for the applications that consume or 
produce it. In the past, when developers created a single extensive application, problems 
tended to appear in one place. Perhaps most of the logic resided in stored procedures, 
but when microservices emerged and became an industry standard, most need to save 
their information. Hence, a topic’s importance grows more than before with monoliths. 
Also, during the transition from monoliths to microservices, many non-relational 
databases are an alternative to solve specific problems, like the cache mechanism for 
saved information with a different structure.

Persistent information is one of the most important aspects of microservices and 
applications. You will lose everything if you don’t preserve the data when you deploy or 
restart or if something happens to your system.
But there are other things you need to consider because they can affect the 
performance of the entire platform, adding latency or errors. The following are some 
problems associated with the inappropriate use or design of a database.

Incrementing the latency to execute the queries and obtain 
information for a database

* Incrementing the usage of CPU/memory for access to a database for 
a wrong design in the way to connect
* Choosing the old version or the incorrect type of database for the 
kind of information to persist

A wrong decision or not understanding the pros/cons of each 
type of database and how access to the information could affect your entire system.

Application services, which should be stateless to play well in a cloud environment. However, most applications are useless if they don’t store any state or data somewhere. 

* The state is everything that should be preserved when shutting down a service
and spinning up a new instance.
* Data services are the stateful components of a cloud native architecture, requir-
ing storage technologies to persist the state, they can be data stores like PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and Redis, or they can be messaging systems like RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka.
* For each cloud native application you design, you should consider the most suitable storage type for the data it will produce. 
* Using data services in the cloud is challenging because it's a dynamic environment.
 Some issues to consider when choosing a data service are scalability, resilience,
performance, and compliance with specific regulations and laws.
* You can use data services that are offered and managed by your cloud provider
or manage your own, either relying on virtual machines or containers.
* The difference between application and data services can also be visualized in
terms of the three basic building blocks of cloud infrastructure: compute, storage, and
network. As shown in figure 5.1, application services use computing and networking
resources because they are stateless. On the other hand, data services are stateful and
require storage to persist the state.
*  Data sources are one of the primary causes of differences across environments. It’s
common practice to use an in-memory database while developing locally—something
like H2 or HSQL. But that affects the predictability and robustness of your applications.
Even if all relational databases speak the SQL language and Spring Data JDBC provides
generic abstractions, each vendor has its own dialect and unique features that make it
essential to use the same database in production that you use in development and test-
ing. Otherwise, you may not catch errors that might happen only in production.

Another reason for using in-memory databases is to make integration tests more accessible. However, integration tests are also supposed to test the integration with your application’s exter-
nal services. Using something like H2 makes those tests less reliable. Each commit
should be a candidate for release when adopting a continuous delivery approach.
Suppose the autotests run by the deployment pipeline are not using the same backing
services used in production. In that case, you’ll need to do extra manual testing
before deploying the application safely in production because you can’t be sure it 

== Choosing a Database
requirements of project, such as:

* the availability,
* volume of data,
* expected traffic,
* ata model complexity,
* desired performance.
* scalability requirements and consider whether the chosen database can handle future growth

data requirements

* How are you planning to query the data?
* Do you need high availability?
* How complex is your data model?
* Are you writing millions of records?
* Do you need very fast readings?

== SQL vs. NoSQL

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem

|===
| Characteristics | Relational (or SQL) Database | NoSQL Database

| *Data model*
| Fixed schema. Altering schemas can be more complex
| Flexible schema. Schema changes are easier

| *Use cases*
| Applications with structured and related data
| Applications with unstructured data such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-based data

| *Transactional consistency*
| ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
| Eventual consistency

| *Data integrity*
| Strong data integrity and validation by defining complex relationships and constraints
| Less strict data integrity checks, as it usually provides minimal support for defining complex relationships

| *Query support*
| SQL-based queries and multi-table joins
| Query capabilities differ among different NoSQL database

| Performance
| Well-suited for complex queries Excellent performance for read-heavy workloads
| Horizontal scaling Limited options Flexible scaling options

| Cost
| Higher cost due to hardware upgrades
| Lower cost due to distributed architecture

There are a few properties you should consider to ensure
you choose the most suitable technology.

* Scalability--Cloud native applications can scale in and out dynamically. Data ser-
vices are no different: they should scale to adapt to increasing or decreasing workloads. The new challenge is scaling while ensuring safe access to the data
storage. The amount of data flying through a system in the cloud is larger than
ever, and there can be sudden increments, so data services should support the
likelihood of increasing workloads and be resilient.
* Resilience--Much like cloud native applications, data services should be resilient
to failures. The new aspect here is that the data persisted using a specific stor-
age technology should also be resilient. One of the key strategies for ensuring
your data is resilient and preventing data loss is duplication. Replicating data
across different clusters and geographical zones makes it even more resilient,
but this comes at a cost. Data services like relational databases allow replication
while ensuring data consistency. Others, like some non-relational databases,
provide a high level of resilience but can't always guarantee data consistency
(they offer what is referred to as eventual consistency).
* Performance--The way data is duplicated can affect performance, which is also
limited by the I/O access latency of the specific storage technology and the net-
work latency. Where the storage is located compared to the data services relying
on it becomes important--this is a concern that we haven't encountered with
cloud native applications.
* Compliance--You might face compliance challenges with data services more than
with cloud native applications. Persisted data is usually critical for businesses
and often contains information protected by specific laws, regulations, or cus-
tomer agreements regarding how it's managed. For example, when dealing
with personal and sensitive information, it's vital that you manage data in accor-
dance with privacy laws. In Europe, that would mean following the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR). In California, there is the California Consumer
Privacy Act (CCPA). In other domains, further laws apply. For example, health
data in the United States should be handled in compliance with the Health Insur-
ance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Both the cloud native storage
and cloud provider should comply with whatever laws or agreements you are
required to respect. Because of this challenge, some organizations dealing with
very sensitive data, like health care providers and banks, prefer to use a type of
cloud native storage on their premises so they have more control over data man-
agement and can ensure compliance with the applicable regulations.

== Categories of data services for the cloud

Data services can be managed by you (as containers or on virtual machines) or by the cloud provider. In the first case you can use more traditional services, and in the second, you can also access multiple services built specifically for the cloud by the provider.

You can find industry-standard services like PostgreSQL, Redis, and MariaDB.
Some cloud providers even offer enhancements on top of them, optimized for scalabil-
ity, availability, performance, and security. For example, should you need a relational
database, you could use Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), Azure Database, or
Google Cloud SQL.

Cloud providers also offer new types of data services specifically built for the cloud
and exposing their own unique APIs. For instance, Google BigQuery is a serverless
data warehouse solution with a particular focus on high scalability. Another example
is the extremely fast, non-relational database Cosmos DB offered by Azure.

The other option is to manage data services yourself, increasing the complexity for
you, but giving you more control over the solution. You can choose to use a more
traditional setup based on virtual machines, or you could use containers and take
advantage of the lessons you’ve learned managing cloud native applications. Using
containers will allow you to manage all the services in your system through a unified
interface, such as Kubernetes, handling both compute and storage resources and
reducing costs.
