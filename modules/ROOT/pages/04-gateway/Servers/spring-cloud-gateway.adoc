= Spring Cloud Gateway Server
:figures: 04-gateway/Servers/spring-cloud-gateway

Spring Cloud Gateway is a project built on top of Spring WebFlux and Project Reactor
to provide an API gateway and a central place to handle cross-cutting concerns like
security, resilience, and monitoring. It’s built for developers, and it’s a good fit in
Spring architectures and heterogeneous environments.

Since it’s based on a reactive stack, it can scale
efficiently to handle the high workload naturally happening at the edge of a system.


For the gateway pattern, Spring Cloud offers two options

* Spring Cloud Netflix(In maintenance mode)
* Spring Cloud Gateway

For Spring Cloud Gateway Reactive the artifact ID is *spring-cloud-starter-gateway*

For Spring Cloud Gateway Server MVC the artifact ID is *spring-cloud-starter-gateway-mvc*

Spring Cloud Gateway is a very flexible project that lets you configure routes the way
that best suits your needs. Here you have configured routes in a property file (applica-
tion.yml or application.properties), but there’s also a DSL available for configuring
routes programmatically in Java or Kotlin. Future versions of the project will also imple-
ment a feature to fetch the route configuration from a data source using Spring Data.
How you use it is up to you. Putting routes in configuration properties gives you the
chance to customize them easily depending on the environment and to update them
at runtime without the need to rebuild and redeploy the application. For example, you
would get those benefits when using Spring Cloud Config Server. On the other hand,
the DSL for Java and Kotlin lets you define more complex routes. Configuration prop-
erties allow you to combine different predicates with an AND logical operator only.
The DSL also enables you to use other logical operators like OR and NOT.

== Defining routes and predicates
Spring Cloud Gateway provides three main building blocks:

* Route—This is identified by a unique ID, a collection of predicates for deciding
whether to follow the route, a URI for forwarding the request if the predicates
allow, and a collection of filters that are applied either before or after forward-
ing the request downstream.
* Predicate—This matches anything from the HTTP request, including path, host,
headers, query parameters, cookies, and body.
* Filter—This modifies an HTTP request or response before or after forwarding
the request to the downstream service.

Suppose a client sends a request to Spring Cloud Gateway. If the request matches a
route through its predicates, the Gateway HandlerMapping will send the request to the
Gateway WebHandler, which in turn will run the request through a chain of filters.

There are two filter chains. One chain contains the filters to be run before the
request is sent to the downstream service. The other chain is run after sending the
request downstream and before forwarding the response. 
image::{figures}/how-the-routing-works-in-spring-cloud-gateway.png[alt text]

A minimal route must be configured with a unique ID, a URI where the request
should be forwarded, and at least one predicate.

          predicates:

----
The project comes with many different predicates built-in, which you can use in
your route configuration to match against any aspect of an HTTP request, including
Cookie, Header, Host, Method, Path, Query, and RemoteAddr. You can also combine them to form AND conditionals.

== Processing requests and responses through filters
Routes and predicates alone make the application act as a proxy, but it’s filters that
make Spring Cloud Gateway really powerful.

Spring Cloud Gateway provides a rich set of filters that you can use to modify
requests and responses. Filters can be used to modify the request before it’s sent to
the downstream service or to modify the response before it’s sent back to the client.
You can also use filters to implement cross-cutting concerns like security, monitoring,
and resilience. Filters can be applied globally to all routes or to specific routes only.
You can also create your own custom filters to implement specific logic that’s not
covered by the built-in filters.  

Filters can run before forwarding incoming requests to a downstream application
(pre-filters). They can be used for:

* Manipulating the request headers
* Applying rate limiting and circuit breaking
* Defining retries and timeouts for the proxied request
* Triggering an authentication flow with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect

Other filters can apply to outgoing responses after they are received from the down-
stream application and before sending them back to the client (post-filters). They can
be used for:

* Setting security headers
* Manipulating the response body to remove sensitive information

== Managing web sessions in a gateway
Spring Cloud Gateway supports web sessions, which are used to store user-specific
data across multiple requests. This is useful for implementing features like user
authentication, authorization, and personalization. 
Spring Cloud Gateway uses the Spring Session project to manage web sessions.
Spring Session provides a way to store web sessions in a distributed data store, such
as Redis, MongoDB, or JDBC. This allows you to share web sessions across multiple
instances of your application, which is useful for scaling your application horizontally.

To use web sessions in Spring Cloud Gateway, you need to add the Spring Session
dependency to your project. check 11-development/02-spring/03-web/session-management

Managing web sessions in a gateway requires some additional care to ensure you save
the right state at the right time. In this example, we want the session to be saved in
Redis before forwarding a request downstream. How can we do that? If you were
thinking about whether there’s a gateway filter for it, you would be right!
The SaveSession gateway filter is used to save the session before forwarding the
request downstream. It’s a pre-filter, so it runs before the request is sent to the
downstream service. This filter is useful for ensuring that the session is saved before
the request is sent downstream, which is important for maintaining the state of the
session across multiple requests. That’s a critical point when Spring Session is combined with Spring Security. 
You can configure the SaveSession filter in the application.yml file, as shown in the
following example:
[source,yml,attributes]
----    
gateway:
    # Configuration properties for the HTTP client
      default-filters:
        #Ensures the session data is saved before forwarding a request downstream
        - name: SaveSession
          args:
            # Whether to save the session before forwarding the request downstream
            saveSession: true 
            # Whether to save the session after forwarding the request downstream
            saveSessionAfter: false
            # Whether to save the session only if it has been modified
            saveSessionIfModified: true
            # Whether to save the session only if it has been created
            saveSessionIfCreated: false
            # Whether to save the session only if it has been accessed
            saveSessionIfAccessed: false
            # Whether to save the session only if it has been destroyed
            saveSessionIfDestroyed: false
            # Whether to save the session only if it has been invalidated
            saveSessionIfInvalidated: false
            # Whether to save the session only if it has been changed 
            saveSessionIfChanged: false
            # Whether to save the session only if it has been saved
            saveSessionIfSaved: false
            # Whether to save the session only if it has been refreshed
            saveSessionIfRefreshed: false
----
You can also configure the SaveSession filter to save the session after forwarding
the request downstream. This is useful for ensuring that the session is saved after
the request is sent downstream, which is important for maintaining the state of the
session across multiple requests. You can also configure the filter to save the session 
only if it has been modified, created, accessed, destroyed, invalidated, changed, saved,
or refreshed. This is useful for ensuring that the session is saved only when it has
been modified, which can help reduce the number of writes to the data store and
improve performance.

[[token-relay-pattern]]
== Token relay pattern
After a user successfully authenticates with Identity provider, Edge Service (the OAuth2 Client) receives an ID Token and an Access Token, In Edge Service, Spring Security uses the ID Token to extract information about the
authenticated user, set up a context for the current user session, and make the data
available through the OidcUser object. 

The Access Token grants Edge Service authorized access to System services (the OAuth2 Resource Servers) on behalf of the user. After we secure
both applications, Edge Service will have to include the Access Token in all requests routed to them as an Authorization HTTP header. Unlike ID Tokens, Edge Service
doesn’t read the Access Token’s content because it’s not the intended audience. It
stores the Access Token received from Identity provider and then includes it as-is in any
request to a protected endpoint downstream.

This pattern is called token relay, and it’s supported by Spring Cloud Gateway as a
built-in filter, so you don’t need to implement anything yourself. When the filter is
enabled, the Access Token is included automatically in all requests sent to one of the
downstream applications. 

image::{figures}/token-relay.png[ After a user is authenticated, Edge Service relays the Access Token to Order Service to call its protected endpoints on behalf of the user.]

Spring Cloud Gateway implements the token relay pattern as a filter. In the Edge Ser-
vice project (edge-service), open the application.yml file and add TokenRelay as a
default filter, since we want it applied to all routes.
[source,yml,attributes]
----
      default-filters:
        # Enables the propagation of the Access Token when calling a downstream service
        - TokenRelay
----
With the filter enabled, Spring Cloud Gateway takes care of propagating the right
Access Token as an Authorization header in all outgoing requests to system services. For example:
[source,console,attributes]
----
GET /orders
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
----

== Resilience with Spring Cloud Gateway
=== Configure timeout
Edge Service uses Netty’s HTTP client to forward requests to downstream services. whenever an application calls an external service, it’s essential to configure a timeout to make it resilient to interprocess communication failures. Spring Cloud Gateway provides dedicated properties to configure the HTTP client timeouts.


[source,yml,attributes]
----
spring:
  application:
    name: edge-service
  lifecycle:
    #    You can also configure the grace period, which is how long the applica-
    # tion can spend processing all the pending requests. After the grace period expires,
    # the application is terminated even if there are still pending requests. By default, the
    # grace period is 30 seconds. 
    timeout-per-shutdown-phase: 15s 
    gateway:
      # Configuration properties for the HTTP client
      httpclient:
        # Time limit for a connection to be established (in ms)
        connect-timeout: 2000 # 2s
        # Time limit for a response to be received (Duration)
        response-timeout: 5s
----
By default, the Netty HTTP client used by Spring Cloud Gateway is configured with an
elastic connection pool to increase the number of concurrent connections dynamically
as the workload increases. Depending on the number of requests your system receives
simultaneously, you might want to switch to a fixed connection pool so you have more
control over the number of connections. You can configure the Netty connection
pool in Spring Cloud Gateway through the spring.cloud.gateway.httpclient.pool
property group in the application.yml file.
[source,yml,attributes]
----
    gateway:
    # Configuration properties for the HTTP client
      httpclient:
        pool:
          # cType of connection pool (elastic, fixed, or disabled)
          type: elastic
          # Idle time after which the communication channel will be closed
          max-idle-time: 15s
          # Time after which the communication channel will be closed
          max-life-time: 60s
----
=== Retry
Spring Cloud Gateway provides a Retry filter that can be used to retry requests to
downstream services in case of failures. This filter can be configured to retry requests
a specific number of times, with a delay between retries. This is useful for handling
transient failures, such as network issues or temporary unavailability of downstream
services. 

You cann apply it as a default filter for all GET requests going through the routes defined in the gateway.

You can configure the Retry filter in the application.yml file, as shown in the
following example:
[source,yml,attributes]
----
    gateway:
    # Configuration properties for the HTTP client
      default-filters:
        - name: Retry
          args:
            # Number of retries to perform
            retries: 3
            # Delay between retries (in ms)
            delay: 1000 # 1s
            # HTTP methods to retry
            methods: GET,POST
            # Status codes to retry
            statuses: 500,502,503,504
            # Whether to retry on connection errors
            retry-on-connect-failure: true
            # Whether to retry on server errors
            retry-on-server-errors: true
            # Whether to retry on client errors
            retry-on-client-errors: false
            # Whether to retry on timeout errors
            retry-on-timeout: true
            # Whether to retry on network errors
            retry-on-network-errors: true
            # Whether to retry on connection refused errors
            retry-on-connection-refused: true
            # Whether to retry on connection reset errors
            retry-on-connection-reset: true
            # Whether to retry on connection closed errors
            retry-on-connection-closed: true
            # Whether to retry on connection aborted errors
            retry-on-connection-aborted: true
            # Whether to retry on connection timeout errors
            retry-on-connection-timeout: true
----

Let’s define a maximum of three retry attempts for all GET requests whenever the
error is in the 5xx range (SERVER_ERROR). We don’t want to retry requests when the
error is in the 4xx range. For example, if the result is a 404 response, it doesn’t make
sense to retry the request. We can also list the exceptions for which a retry should be
attempted, such as IOException and TimeoutException.

By now, you know that you shouldn’t keep retrying requests one after the other.
You should use a backoff strategy instead. By default, the delay is computed using the
formula firstBackoff * (factor ^ n). If you set the basedOnPreviousValue parame-
ter to true, the formula will be prevBackoff * factor.

----
== Resilience with Circuit Breaker
Spring Cloud Gateway provides a Circuit Breaker filter that can be used to implement
the circuit breaker pattern. This filter can be configured to open the circuit after a
specific number of failures, and to close the circuit after a specific time period. This is
useful for handling failures in downstream services and preventing cascading failures
in the system.  

Spring Cloud Gateway integrates natively with Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker, providing you with a CircuitBreaker gateway filter that you can use to protect the inter-
actions with all downstream services. 

The CircuitBreaker filter in Spring Cloud Gateway relies on Spring Cloud Circuit
Breaker to wrap a route. As with the Retry filter, you can choose to apply it to specific
routes or define it as a default filter. 

When a circuit breaker switches to the open state, we’ll want at least to degrade the
service level gracefully and make the user experience as pleasant as possible. You can also specify
an optional fallback URI to handle the request when the circuit is in an open state. 
The fallback URI can be a static response, a custom error page, or a route to another
service that can handle the request.

You can configure the Circuit Breaker filter in the application.yml file, as shown in
the following example:

            # Number of failures before opening the circuit
            failure-threshold: 5
            # Time period to keep the circuit open (in ms)
            wait-duration-in-open-state: 10000 # 10s
            # Time period to keep the circuit half-open (in ms)

            record-timeout-errors: true
            # Whether to record network errors as failures
            record-network-errors: true
----
In this example (application.yml), both routes will be configured with a CircuitBreaker
filter, but only catalog-route will have a fallbackUri  
[source,yml,attributes]
----
routes:
  - id: catalog-route
    uri: ${CATALOG_SERVICE_URL:http://localhost:9001}/books
    predicates:
      - Path=/books/**
    filters:
      - name: CircuitBreaker
        args:
          name: catalogCircuitBreaker
          # Forwards request to this URI when the circuit is open
          fallbackUri: forward:/catalog-fallback
  - id: order-route
    uri: ${ORDER_SERVICE_URL:http://localhost:9002}/orders
    predicates:
      - Path=/orders/**
    filters:
      - name: CircuitBreaker
        args:
          # No fallback defined for this circuit breaker.
          name: orderCircuitBreaker  
----
After defining which routes you want to apply the CircuitBreaker filter to, you need
to configure the circuit breakers themselves. As often in Spring Boot, you have two
main choices. You can configure circuit breakers through the properties provided by
Resilience4J or via a Customizer bean. Since we’re using the reactive version of Resil-
ience4J, the specific configuration bean would be of type Customizer<Reactive-
Resilience4JCircuitBreakerFactory>.

The timeout configured via Resilience4J will take precedence over the response timeout 
defined in the Netty HTTP client (spring.cloud.gateway.httpclient.response-timeout).

For the current example, we can define circuit breakers to consider a window of 20
calls (slidingWindowSize). Each new call will make the window move, dropping the
oldest registered call. When at least 50% of the calls in the window have produced an
error (failureRateThreshold), the circuit breaker will trip, and the circuit will enter
the open state. After 15 seconds (waitDurationInOpenState), the circuit will be
allowed to transition to a half-open state in which 5 calls are permitted (permitted-
NumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState). If at least 50% of them result in an error, the circuit
will go back to the open state. Otherwise, the circuit breaker will trip to the closed state.

[source,yml,attributes]
----
resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    configs:
      # Default configuration bean for all circuit breakers
      default:
        #The size of the sliding window used to record the outcome of calls when the circuit is closed
        slidingWindowSize: 20
        # Number of permitted calls when the circuit is half-open
        permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState: 5
        # When the failure rate is above the threshold, the circuit becomes open.
        failureRateThreshold: 50
        # Waiting time before moving from open to half-open (ms)
        waitDurationInOpenState: 15000
  timelimiter:
    configs:
      # Default configuration bean for all time limiters
      default:
        # Configures a timeout (seconds)
        timeoutDuration: 5s 
----
=== verify the result of applying these patterns 
You can verify the result of applying these patterns to Edge Service by using a tool like
Apache Benchmark (https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html).

Make sure both Catalog Service and Order Service are not running so that you can
test circuit breakers in a failure scenario. Then enable debug logging for Resilience4J so you can follow the state transitions of the circuit breaker. At the end of the applica-
tion.yml file in your Edge Service project, add the following configuration.

This command sends 21 POST requests to the Edge Service.
You should see the circuit breaker switching between the open and half-open states
as the requests are sent to the Edge Service. The fallback URI is called when the cir-cuit is open, and the response status code is 503 Service Unavailable. The response
body is empty because the fallback response is not configured to return any content. 

=== Rate limiting
Resilience4J supports the client-side rate limiter and bulkhead patterns for both
reactive and non-reactive applications. Spring Cloud Gateway supports the server-side
rate limiter pattern. 

Imagine you want to limit access to your API so that each user can only perform 10
requests per second. Implementing such a requirement would require a storage
mechanism to track the number of requests each user performs every second. When
the limit is reached, the following requests should be rejected. When the second is
over, each user can perform 10 more requests within the next second. The data used
by the rate-limiting algorithm is small and temporary, so you might think of saving it
in memory inside the application itself.

the RequestRateLimiter gateway filter provides server-side rate limiting support. Depending on the requirements, you can configure the RequestRateLimiter filter
for specific routes or as a default filter.

The RequestRateLimiter filter relies on a KeyResolver bean to determine which
bucket to use for each request. By default, it uses the currently authenticated user in
Spring Security. 
If you don’t use Spring Security, you can define your own KeyResolver bean to
determine the key to use for each request. The KeyResolver bean should implement
the KeyResolver interface, which has a single method, resolve(ServerWebExchange
exchange). This method receives the ServerWebExchange object, which contains
the HTTP request and response, and returns a Mono<String> that contains the key to
use for the request. The key is used to identify the bucket for the rate-limiting 
algorithm. For example, you can use the user’s IP address, the request path, or any
other aspect of the request to determine the key. The KeyResolver bean is used by
the RequestRateLimiter filter to determine which bucket to use for each request.

all requests will be mapped to the same bucket.

----
The RequestRateLimiter filter is implemented on top of Redis, which is used to
store the rate-limiting data. Redis is a fast, in-memory data store that can
handle high throughput and low latency. It’s a good fit for rate limiting because it
can store the data in memory and provide fast access to it. The RequestRateLimiter
filter uses Redis to store the rate-limiting data, which is used to track the number of requests each user performs every second. The filter uses Redis to store the
buckets for each user, where each bucket contains the number of tokens available for
the user. The filter uses the Redis data store to track the number of requests each user
performs every second and to determine whether to allow or reject the request based on the
rate-limiting algorithm.  

What happens if Redis becomes unavailable? Spring Cloud Gateway
has been built with resilience in mind, so it will keep its service level, but the
rate limiters would be disabled until Redis is up and running again.

The implementation of RequestRateLimiter on Redis is based on the token bucket
algorithm(check  (https://stripe.com/blog/rate-limiters)). Each user is assigned a bucket inside which tokens are dripped over time at
a specific rate (the replenish rate). Each bucket has a maximum capacity (the burst
capacity). When a user makes a request, a token is removed from its bucket. When
there are no more tokens left, the request is not permitted, and the user will have to
wait until more tokens are dripped into its bucket.

There’s no general rule to follow in coming up with good numbers for the request
rate limiter. You should start with your application requirements and go with a trial
and error approach: analyze your production traffic, tune the configuration, and do
this all over again until you achieve a setup that keeps your system available while not
affecting the user experience badly. Even after that, you should keep monitoring the
status of your rate limiters, since things can change in the future.

Add the following dependency to your Edge Service project to use the Redis-based
RequestRateLimiter filter:
[source,gradle,attributes]
----
dependencies {
 implementation 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-gateway'
 implementation 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-redis-rate-limiter'
}

[source,xml,attributes]
----
<dependency>
 <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>   
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-redis-rate-limiter</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
+
in the application.yml file, configure the Redis integration through the properties provided by Spring Boot
[source,yml,attributes]
----
  spring:
    data:
      redis:
        connect-timeout: 2s
        host: localhost
        port: 6379
        timeout: 1s
----
Configure the RequestRateLimiter filter as a default filter in the application.yml file.
This way, it will be applied to all routes defined in the gateway. You can also apply
it to specific routes only, but in this case, you would need to define the filter inside
the route definition.
+
The following example shows how to configure the RequestRateLimiter filter as a
default filter in the application.yml file. The filter is configured to allow 10 requests
per second, with a burst capacity of 20 requests. Each request costs one token, and
tokens are dripped into the bucket at a rate of 10 tokens per second. This means    
that each user can perform 10 requests per second, and if there’s a spike in the
number of requests, up to 20 requests can be allowed in a single second. If two
spikes happen sequentially, only the first one will succeed, while the second will
result in some requests being dropped with an HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests
response.

      default-filters:
        # let’s configure the algorithm so that each request costs 1 token
        # (redis-rate-limiter.requestedTokens). Tokens are dripped in the bucket follow-
        # ing the configured replenish rate (redis-rate-limiter.replenishRate), which we’ll
        # set as 10 tokens per second. Sometimes there might be spikes, resulting in a larger
        # number of requests than usual. You can allow temporary bursts by defining a larger
        # capacity for the bucket (redis-rate-limiter.burstCapacity), such as 20. This
        # means that when a spike occurs, up to 20 requests are allowed per second. Since the
        # replenish rate is lower than the burst capacity, subsequent bursts are not allowed.
        # If two spikes happen sequentially, only the first one will succeed, while the second
        # will result in some requests being dropped with an HTTP 429 - Too Many Requests
        # response.
        - name: RequestRateLimiter
          args:
            redis-rate-limiter:
              # Number of tokens dripped in the bucket each second
              replenishRate: 10
              # Allows request bursts of up to 20 requests
              burstCapacity: 20

Spring Cloud Gateway is configured to append headers with details about rate-limiting
to each HTTP response, which we can use to verify its behavior. 

the rate-limiting above is computed based on the total number of requests received every second. We should update it to apply the rate limits to each user independently.
[source,java,attributes]

    @Bean
    KeyResolver keyResolver() {
        return exchange -> exchange.getPrincipal()
                .map(Principal::getName)
                .defaultIfEmpty("anonymous");
    }

=== Combining patterns
When you combine multiple resilience patterns, the sequence in which they are
applied is fundamental. Spring Cloud Gateway takes care of applying the TimeLimiter
first (or the timeout on the HTTP client), then the CircuitBreaker filter, and finally
Retry. 
image::{figures}/Combining-resilience-patterns.png[When multiple resilience patterns are implemented, they are applied in a specific sequence.]

When the rate limiter pattern is combined with other patterns like
time limiters, circuit breakers, and retries, the rate limiter is applied first. If a
user’s request exceeds the rate limit, it is rejected right away.
