= Docker
:figures: 16-deployment/packaging/docker

The Open Container Initiative (OCI), a Linux Foundation project, defines industry
standards for working with containers (https://opencontainers.org). In particular, the
OCI Image Specification defines how to build container images, the OCI Runtime
Specification defines how to run those container images, and the OCI Distribution
Specification defines how to distribute them. The tool we’ll use to work with contain-
ers is Docker (www.docker.com), which is compliant with the OCI specifications.


*Docker* is an open source platform that provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container

When you install the Docker platform on your machine, you get the Docker Engine
package characterized by a client/server architecture. 

The *Docker server* contains the Docker daemon, a background process responsible for creating and managing Docker
objects like images, containers, volumes, and networks. The machine where the
Docker server runs is called the Docker host. Each machine where you want to run con-
tainers should be a Docker host, so it should have a Docker daemon running. The
portability of containers is made possible by the daemon process itself.

The *Docker daemon* exposes an API you can use to send instructions, such as to
run a container or create a volume. The Docker client talks to the daemon through that
API. The client is command-line based and can be used to interact with the Docker
daemon either through scripting (for example, Docker Compose) or through the
Docker CLI directly.

Next figure shows how the Docker client, Docker server,and container registry interact.

A *container image* (or, simply, an image) is a lightweight executable package that
includes everything needed to run the application inside. The Docker image format is
the most used one for creating container images, and it has been standardized by the
OCI project (in the OCI Image Specification). OCI images can be created from
scratch by defining instructions in a Dockerfile, a text-based file containing all the
steps to generate the image.

Container images follow common naming conventions, which are adopted by OCI-
compliant container registries: +++<container_registry>+++/+++<namespace>+++/+++<name>+++[:+++<tag>+++]:+++</tag>++++++</name>++++++</namespace>++++++</container_registry>+++

* Container registry--The hostname for the container registry where the image is
stored. When using Docker Hub, the hostname is docker.io and it's usually
omitted. The Docker Engine will implicitly prepend the image name with
docker.io if you don't specify a registry. When using GitHub Container Regis-
try, the hostname is ghcr.io and must be explicit.
* Namespace--When using Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry, the name-
space will be your Docker/GitHub username written all in lowercase. In other
registries, it might be the path to the repository.
* Name and tag--The image name represents the repository (or package) that con-
tains all the versions of your image. It's optionally followed by a tag for selecting
a specific version. If no tag is defined, the latest tag will be used by default.

Official images like ubuntu or postgresql can be downloaded by specifying the name
only, which is implicitly converted to fully qualified names like docker.io/library/
ubuntu or docker.io/library/postgres.
 When uploading your images to GitHub Container Registry, you are required
to use fully qualified names, according to the ghcr.io/+++<your_github_username>+++/+++</your_github_username>++++++<image_name>+++format. 

A **container** is a runnable instance of a container image. You can manage the con- tainer life cycle from the Docker CLI or Docker Compose: you can start, stop, update, and delete containers. Containers are defined by the image on which they are based and the configuration provided at startup time (for example, environment variables used to customize the container). By default, containers are isolated from each other and the host machine, but you can make them expose services to the outside world through specific ports with a process called port forwarding or port mapping. Containers can have any name. If you don't specify one, the Docker server will assign a random one, like bazinga_schrodinger. 

== Docker Compose
Docker Compose provides a better experience than the Docker CLI. Instead of a command line, you work with YAML files that describe which containers you want to run and their characteristics. With Docker Compose, you can define all the applica- tions and services composing your system in one place, and you can manage their life cycles together. It's good practice to gather all deployment-related scripts in a separate codebase and, possibly, in a separate repository i.e \{project-name}-deployment folder. It'll contain all the Docker and Kubernetes scripts needed to run the applications composing your system. ## Security containers run using the root user by default, potentially letting them get root access to the Docker host. You can mitigate the risk by creating a non-privileged user and using it to run the entry- point process defined in the Dockerfile, following the principle of least privilege.

== Containerizing applications with Docker
Before deploying an application to the cloud, however, you should containerize it. Why? Containers provide isolation from the surrounding
environment, and they’re equipped with all the dependencies required by the appli-
cation to run.

Most of the dependencies are managed by Gradle and are packaged
together with the application (JAR artifact). But the Java runtime is not included.

Without a container, you would have to install the Java runtime on any machine where
you want to deploy the application. Containerizing the application means it will be
self-contained and portable across any cloud environment. With containers you can
manage all applications in a standard way, no matter the language or framework used
to implement them.
