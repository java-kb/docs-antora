*Kubernetes* (often shortened as K8s) is an open source container orchestrator hosted by the CNCF.it's an open source system for automating
the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications (https://
kubernetes.io).

When you are working with containers in Docker, your deployment
target is a machine. In the example from the previous section, it was your computer.
In other scenarios it might be a virtual machine (VM). In any case, it’s about deploy-
ing containers to a specific machine. However, when it comes to deploying containers
without downtime, scaling them by leveraging the cloud’s elasticity, or connecting
them across different hosts, you’ll need something more than a container engine.
Instead of deploying to a specific machine, you are deploying to a cluster of machines,
and Kubernetes, among other things, manages a cluster of machines for you

When using a container topology, you need a machine with a container runtime.
With Kubernetes, however, you switch to an orchestration topology, meaning that you
need a cluster. A Kubernetes cluster is a set of worker machines (nodes) that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

A Kubernetes cluster comprises machines called worker nodes on which your con-
tainerized applications are deployed. They provide capacity such as CPU, memory,
network, and storage so that the containers can run and connect to a network.

The control plane is the container orchestration layer that manages the worker
nodes. It exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the life cycle
of containers. It offers all the essential elements that implement the typical features of an orchestrator, like cluster management, scheduling, and health monitoring.

kubectl is a CLI client, which communicates with the control plane to perform some operations on the worker nodes. A client doesn't interact with the worker nodes directly.

* Pod--The smallest deployable unit, which can include one or more containers.
A Pod usually contains only one of your applications. It might also include extra
containers supporting the primary application (such as containers providing
additional functionality like logging or administrative tasks to run during the
initialization step). Kubernetes manages Pods rather than containers directly.
* Deployment--A Deployment informs Kubernetes about the desired deployment
state for your application. For each instance, it creates a Pod and keeps it
healthy. Among other things, a Deployment allows you to manage Pods as a set.
* Service--A Deployment (a set of Pods) can be exposed to other nodes in the
cluster or outside by defining a Service that also takes care of balancing the load
between Pod instances.

When you want to run a new application, you can define a resource manifest, a file that
describes the desired state for the application. For example, you might specify that it
should be replicated five times and exposed to the outside world through port 8080.
Resource manifests are usually written using YAML. You can then use the kubectl cli-
ent to ask the control plane to create the resources described by the manifest. In the
end, the control plane processes the request using its internal components and cre-
ates the resources in the worker nodes. The control plane still relies on a container
registry to fetch the image defined in the resource manifest. The workflow, again, is
shown in above figure.

== Useful Kubernetes CLI commands for managing Pods, Deployments, and Services
