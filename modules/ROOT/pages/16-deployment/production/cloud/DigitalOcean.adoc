= DigitalOcean
Before moving on, you need to ensure that you have a DigitalOcean account. Follow the instructions on the official website to create an account and start a free trial (https://try.digitalocean.com/freetrialoffer).

There are two main options for interacting with the DigitalOcean platform. 

- The first one is through the web portal (https://cloud.digitalocean.com), which is very convenient for exploring the available services and their features. 
- The second option is via ``doctl``, the DigitalOcean CLI.
