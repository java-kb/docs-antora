= GitHub Actions
:figures: 16-deployment/continuous-delivery/github-actions

GitHub Actions is a platform built into GitHub that lets you automate software workflows directly from your code repositories.

A workflow is an automated process. Each workflow
listens to specific events that trigger its execution.
For example, a workflow can be triggered by a code commit, a pull request, or a
scheduled time. Workflows can also be triggered manually by a user.
Workflows are defined in YAML files and can be stored in the .github/workflows folder of a GitHub repository. They can be used to build, test, package, release, and deploy applications.
Workflows can also be used to automate tasks such as sending notifications, updating documentation, or managing issues and pull requests.

Each workflow is organized into jobs that run in parallel. Each job is executed on a
runner instance, which is a server provided by GitHub. You can choose between
Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.

Each job is composed of steps, which are executed sequentially. A step could be either
a shell command or an action. Actions are custom applications used to perform com-
plex tasks in a more structured and reproducible way. For example, you could have
actions for packaging an application into an executable, running tests, creating a container image, or pushing an image to a container registry. The GitHub organiza-
tion provides a basic set of actions, but there's also a marketplace with many more
actions developed by the community.

When using actions from the GitHub marketplace, handle them
like any other third-party application and manage the security risks accord-
ingly. Prefer using trusted actions provided by GitHub or verified organiza-
tions over other third-party options.


== Create Workflows

Workflows should be defined in a .github/workflows folder in a GitHub repository
root, and they should be described following the YAML format provided by GitHub Actions.

== Deployment pipeline(commit-stage): static code analysis, compilation, unit tests, and integration tests
create a commit-stage.yml
file under a new .github/workflows folder. This workflow will be triggered whenever
new code is pushed to the repository.

After completing the declaration of the initial commit stage for the deployment pipe-
line, commit your changes and push them to the remote GitHub repository. The
newly created workflow will be immediately triggered. You can see the execution
results on your GitHub repository page on the Actions tab.
image::{figures}/image.png[The commit stage workflow is executed after you push new changes to the remote repository.]
By keeping the result of
the commit stage green, you can be quite sure that you haven't broken anything or
introduced new regressions (assuming that you have proper tests in place).

After scanning the Java project for vulnerabilities, we also included a step to fetch
the security report generated by grype and upload it to GitHub, independently of
whether the build succeeds or not. If any security vulnerability is found, you can see
the results in the Security tab of your GitHub repository page

== Deployment pipeline(commit-stage): Package and publish

define a few environment variables to store some essential facts you’ll need when building a container image for the application. By using environment variables, you can easily change
which container registry you use or the version for the release artifact. 
[source,yml,attributes]
----
env:
 REGISTRY: ghcr.io  
 IMAGE_NAME: <your_github_username>/catalog-service
 VERSION: latest 
----

add a new “Package and Publish” job to the workflow
[source,yml,attributes]
----
  package: 
    name: Package and Publish
    # This job runs only on the main branch
    if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }} 
    # Runs the job only if the “build” job completes successfully
    needs: [ build ] 
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04 
    permissions:
      # Grants the job permissions to read the repository contents and write to the package registry
      # This is necessary for the job to be able to push the Docker image to the registry
      contents: read 
      packages: write 
      # Grants the job permissions to write security events, such as security vulnerability reports
      security-events: write 
    steps:
      - name: Checkout source code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3 
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3 
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: 17
          cache: maven
      - name: Build container image
        run: |
          chmod +x mvnw
          ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image --imageName ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.VERSION }}
----
After packaging the application as a container image, update the commit-
stage.yml file to use grype to scan the image for vulnerabilities and publish a report to
GitHub

add a new “Package and Publish” job to the workflow
[source,yml,attributes]
----
      - name: OCI image vulnerability scanning
        uses: anchore/scan-action@v3 
        id: scan
        with: 
          image: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.VERSION }}
          fail-build: false 
          severity-cutoff: high 
      #Scans the release candidate image for vulnerabilities using grype
      - name: Upload vulnerability report
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2 
        if: success() || failure()
        with:
          sarif_file: ${{ steps.scan.outputs.sarif }}
----
Finally, we can authenticate with the con-
tainer registry and push the image representing our release candidate.
[source,yml,attributes]
----
      - name: Log into container registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v2 
        with:
          registry: ${{ env.REGISTRY }} 
          username: ${{ github.actor }} 
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} 
      - name: Publish container image 
        run: docker push ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ env.VERSION }}

== Deployment pipeline(commit-stage): Validate Kubernetes manifests
Since a manifest specifies the desired state of an object, we should ensure that
our specification complies with the API exposed by Kubernetes. It’s a good idea to
automate this validation in the commit stage of a deployment pipeline to get fast
feedback in case of errors (rather than waiting until the acceptance stage, where we
need to use those manifests to deploy the application in a Kubernetes cluster)

Go to your Catalog Service project (catalog-service), and open the commit-stage.yml
file within the .github/workflows folder.
