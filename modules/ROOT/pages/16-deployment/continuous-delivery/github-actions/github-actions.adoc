= GitHub Actions
:figures: 16-deployment/continuous-delivery/github-actions

GitHub Actions is a platform built into GitHub that lets you automate software workflows directly from your code repositories.

A workflow is an automated process. Each workflow
listens to specific events that trigger its execution.

Workflows should be defined in a .github/workflows folder in a GitHub repository
root, and they should be described following the YAML format provided by GitHub
Actions.

Each workflow is organized into jobs that run in parallel. Each job is executed on a
runner instance, which is a server provided by GitHub. You can choose between
Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.

Each job is composed of steps, which are executed sequentially. A step could be either
a shell command or an action. Actions are custom applications used to perform com-
plex tasks in a more structured and reproducible way. For example, you could have
actions for packaging an application into an executable, running tests, creating a container image, or pushing an image to a container registry. The GitHub organiza-
tion provides a basic set of actions, but there's also a marketplace with many more
actions developed by the community.

== Create Workflows

Workflows should be defined in a .github/workflows folder in a GitHub repository
root, and they should be described following the YAML format provided by GitHub Actions.

create a commit-stage.yml
file under a new .github/workflows folder. This workflow will be triggered whenever
new code is pushed to the repository.

After completing the declaration of the initial commit stage for the deployment pipe-
line, commit your changes and push them to the remote GitHub repository. The
newly created workflow will be immediately triggered. You can see the execution
results on your GitHub repository page on the Actions tab.
image::{figures}/image.png[The commit stage workflow is executed after you push new changes to the remote repository.]
By keeping the result of
the commit stage green, you can be quite sure that you haven't broken anything or
introduced new regressions (assuming that you have proper tests in place).

After scanning the Java project for vulnerabilities, we also included a step to fetch
the security report generated by grype and upload it to GitHub, independently of
whether the build succeeds or not. If any security vulnerability is found, you can see
the results in the Security tab of your GitHub repository page
