= RabbitMQ
:figures: 10-message-queuing/servers

A messaging system requires two main things: a message broker and a protocol. The
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) ensures interoperability across platforms and reliable message delivery. It has become widely used in modern architectures, and it’s a good fit in the cloud, where we need resilience, loose coupling, and
scalability. RabbitMQ is a popular open source message broker that relies on AMQP
and provides flexible asynchronous messaging, distributed deployment, and monitoring. Recent RabbitMQ versions have also introduced event streaming features.

RabbitMQ is a message broker based on the AMQP protocol that you can use to
implement event-driven architectures based on the pub/sub model.

RabbitMQ is a widely used open-source message broker that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It provides a robust and flexible platform for building distributed systems and enables asynchronous communication between different components of an application.

RabbitMQ allows applications to send and receive messages in a decoupled manner, enabling them to operate independently. It supports various messaging patterns, including point-to-point, publish-subscribe, and request-reply, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.

RabbitMQ was initially developed to support AMQP, but it also supports other protocols, including STOMP, MQTT, and even WebSockets for
delivering messages over HTTP. Since version 3.9, it also supports event
streaming.

RabbitMQ provides features such as message persistence, delivery guarantees, and message routing, which are essential for building reliable and scalable applications.
It also supports multiple messaging protocols, including AMQP, MQTT, and STOMP, allowing it to integrate with various programming languages and frameworks.

RabbitMQ is designed to be highly available and can be deployed in a clustered configuration to ensure fault tolerance and scalability. It provides management tools and APIs for monitoring and managing message queues, exchanges, and bindings, making it easy to administer and maintain.

RabbitMQ is a powerful message broker that enables asynchronous communication between components in a distributed system. It provides the necessary features and flexibility to build reliable and scalable applications, making it a popular choice for developers and organizations looking to implement message queuing in their systems.

== Using RabbitMQ with docker
To run RabbitMQ in a Docker container, you can use the official RabbitMQ image from Docker Hub. Here’s a simple command to start a RabbitMQ container with the management plugin enabled, which provides a web-based UI for managing RabbitMQ:
```bash
docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:management
```
This command does the following:

- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `--name rabbitmq`: Names the container "rabbitmq".
- `-p 5672:5672`: Maps the RabbitMQ default port (5672) for AMQP communication.
- `-p 15672:15672`: Maps the RabbitMQ management plugin port (15672) for the web UI.
- `rabbitmq:management`: Specifies the RabbitMQ image with the management plugin enabled. 

After running this command, RabbitMQ will be accessible at `http://localhost:15672` in your web browser, and you can log in with the default credentials:

- Username: `guest`
- Password: `guest`

You can also customize the RabbitMQ configuration by mounting a configuration file or using environment variables. For example, to set a custom username and password, you can use the following command:
```bash
docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 \
  -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=myuser \
  -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=mypassword \
  rabbitmq:management
```
This command sets the default username to `myuser` and the password to `mypassword`. You can then access the RabbitMQ management UI using these credentials.
== RabbitMQ Management UI
The RabbitMQ Management UI is a web-based interface that allows you to manage and monitor your RabbitMQ   
server. It provides a user-friendly way to view queues, exchanges, bindings, and message statistics.

To access the management UI, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:15672`. You can log in using the default credentials or the ones you set when starting the RabbitMQ
container.
/
The management UI provides various features, including:

- Viewing and managing queues and exchanges
- Monitoring message rates and statistics
- Creating and deleting queues and exchanges
- Managing users and permissions
- Viewing message details and contents   

The management UI is a powerful tool for administering RabbitMQ and provides insights into the message flow and
system performance. It is especially useful for debugging and monitoring your RabbitMQ setup in a development or production environment.

== Using RabbitMQ with docker compose
To run RabbitMQ using Docker Compose, you can create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:management  
    container_name: rabbitmq
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"        # AMQP port
      - "15672:15672"      # Management UI port
    environment:
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: myuser
      RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: mypassword 
    volumes:
        - ./rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf:/etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf
      - rabbitmq_data:/var/lib/rabbitmq  # Persistent data storage  
volumes:
  rabbitmq_data:
```

```yaml
  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3.11.8-management
    mem_limit: 512m
    ports:
      - 5672:5672
      - 15672:15672
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "rabbitmqctl", "status"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 2s
      retries: 60
```
This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a RabbitMQ service with the management plugin enabled. It maps the necessary ports and sets the default username and password. It also uses a named volume (`rabbitmq_data`) to persist RabbitMQ data across container restarts. 

The configuration is based on a file mounted as a volume (`./rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf`), which you can create to customize RabbitMQ settings. Make sure to create the `rabbitmq` directory in the same location as your `docker-compose.yml` file and place your configuration file there.
You can customize the RabbitMQ configuration by creating a `rabbitmq.conf` file in the `./rabbitmq` directory. Here’s an example of what that file might look like:
```conf
# rabbitmq.conf
# Custom RabbitMQ configuration
listeners.tcp.default = 5672
management.listener.port = 15672
management.listener.ip =    
default_user = user
default_pass = password
```
This configuration file sets the default TCP listener port, management listener port, and default user credentials. You can add more configuration options as needed based on your RabbitMQ requirements.
You can also customize the RabbitMQ configuration further by adding additional settings to the `rabbitmq.conf` file. For example, you can configure virtual hosts, enable SSL, or set up clustering options.
Make sure to adjust the paths and settings according to your environment and requirements.      
Once you have created the `docker-compose.yml` file and the `rabbitmq.conf` file, you can start RabbitMQ using Docker Compose. This setup allows you to easily manage RabbitMQ as a service, making it convenient for development and testing purposes.

You can also scale RabbitMQ by adding more instances or configuring clustering options in the `docker-compose.yml` file. This flexibility allows you to adapt RabbitMQ to your application's needs, whether you're running a single instance for development or a clustered setup for production.
You can also add additional services to your `docker-compose.yml` file to create a complete application stack. For example, you can add a web application service that communicates with RabbitMQ to send and receive messages. This way, you can easily set up a development environment with all the necessary components running in Docker containers.

You can also use Docker Compose to define networks, volumes, and other services that your application might need. This allows you to create a complete development environment with all the necessary components running in Docker containers, making it easy to manage and deploy your application.


To start RabbitMQ using Docker Compose, run the following command in the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This command will start the RabbitMQ container in detached mode. You can then access the RabbitMQ Management UI at `http://localhost:15672` using the credentials you specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file (`myuser` and `mypassword` in this example).

== Making messaging resilient to failures
RabbitMQ itself has several features in place to improve reliability and resilience.
Among other things, it guarantees that each message is delivered at least once. Be aware that consumers in your applications might receive the same message twice, so
your business logic should know how to identify and handle duplicates.
