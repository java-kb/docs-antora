= Health Check
:figures: 06-health

Like we go for regular health checkup, similarly we should check the health of our microservices as well. Sometimes a service instance can be incapable of handling requests yet still be running. They might have ran out of database connections. Whenever this occurs, the monitoring system should generate a alert. Also, the load balancer or service registry should not route requests to the failed service instance.

A service has an health check API endpoint (e.g. HTTP /health) that returns the health of the service. The API endpoint handler performs various checks e.g: status of DB connections, disk space or any application specific logic.

When can add Actuator dependency (spring-boot-starter-actuator) in our project. The API endpoint in this case is http//localhost:portnumber/actuator/health.

A system running on a production environment is never safe from errors. Network
connections may fail, or a microservice instance may crash due to an out-of-memory
problem caused by a bug in the code. You're determined to build a resilient system,
so you want to be prepared against these errors with mechanisms like redundancy
(multiple replicas of the same microservice) to minimize the impact of these incidents.

So, how do you know when a microservice is not working? If it's exposing an
interface (like a REST API or RabbitMQ), you could interact with a sample probe and
see if it reacts to it. But then, you should be careful when selecting that probe since you
want to cover all possible scenarios that would make your microservice transition to
an unhealthy state (not functional). Instead of leaking the logic to determine whether
a service is working or not to the caller, it's much better to provide a standard, dumb
probe interface that just indicates whether the service is healthy. It's up to the service's
logic to decide when to transition to an unhealthy state, based on the availability of the
interfaces it uses, its own availability, and the criticality of the error. If the service can't
even provide a response, the callers can also assume that it's unhealthy.

This simple interface convention to determine the healthiness of services is required
by many tools and frameworks (and not only for microservices). For example, load
balancers can temporarily stop diverting traffic to an instance that doesn't respond to
the health probe or responds with a non-ready state. Service discovery tools may remove
an instance from the registry if it's unhealthy. Container platforms like Kubernetes can
decide to restart a service if it's not healthy for a configured period

Each service registers itself with
a configured health check to be polled every ten seconds (the default value, but you can
change it). The registry doesn't know in real time when services are not ready to handle
the traffic. It could be the case that Consul successfully checks the health of a given
instance and that one goes down immediately after. The registry will list this instance
as healthy for a few seconds (almost ten with your configuration) until it notices it's not
available during the next check. Since you want to minimize request errors during that
interval too, you can take advantage of the retry pattern to cover these situations. Once
the registry is updated, the Gateway won't get the unhealthy instance in the service list,
so the retries won't be necessary anymore. Note that lowering the time between checks
can reduce the number of errors, but it increases the network traffic
