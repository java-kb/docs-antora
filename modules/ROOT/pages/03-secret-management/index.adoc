= Secret Management
:figures: 03-secret-management

Secret management is an approach that enables programmers to safely store delicate information, such as tokens, passwords, and keys, in a secure setting with rigorous access controls.

Secret management may be easy to implement in smaller software projects. However, as teams and software codebases expand, more secrets are distributed throughout an application ecosystem, making them more challenging to maintain. Secrets are necessary for the operation of microservices, development tools, containers, orchestrators, and API connections and must be stored and maintained securely.

Secrets management also makes it possible to manage microservices-based architecture more effectively. Maintaining the capacity to build, test, and deploy microservices is essential as CI/CD cycles get shorter. Better secrets management makes it possible for the entire cloud architecture to maintain flexibility and scalability without compromising security.
